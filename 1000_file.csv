My Tic Tac Gun 2 has some updates and fixes, I also took into account some of the suggestions on the comments from the original Thing.
Updates:
Trigger mechanism was redesigned to prevent the tictacs falling out of the barrel.
Loading mechanism was redesigned for more reliable loading and firing.
Tictac box connection point was updated to allow for two different sized boxes.
a ""Set"" window on the left side was added to quickly see if the tictac is correctly seated and ready to fire.
Trigger was moved forward slightly.
break-away bridge supports were added for cleaner printing, (can be easily snapped away before use)
Two versions - one for 4mm ""Pen Spring"", another for 6mm BIG Spring (recommended).
For 6mm spring (I used 6mm OD, 0.6 wire size, 50MM free length) - Amazon UK link: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076LTYY5K/ref=cm_sw_r_u_apa_glt_fabc_FZZBQ8SBB9D0Q93MNVQS?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
Overall model adjustments for cleaner 3d printing.
Please make sure the screw holding the trigger is NOT LOOSE, you must tighten it, otherwise it may not lock in place correctly when the gun is set for firing <<<
Please note that 3D printing orientation was taken seriously when designing the parts. all parts can be printing without supports.
Any suggestions please leave them in the comments.
Again, an excellent design by the originator, his summary is below.
Hopefully, it works well for everyone, Enjoy!
ORIGINAL CREATORS SUMMARY:
The 3-D printed TicTac gun - It fits any tictac container first take out the plastic insert for the tictac container flip the gun upside down then connect it should fit snug.
Second for the spring inside the gun I used a spring from a ballpoint pen clicky top you can use any spring that’s the same size
There’s a couple ways to secure both half‘s you can glue on one half to another or use screws to clamp and Secure both halves"

Printed vertically as shown in the render, however I'm sure it would also work on its side without supports (this may also be a bit stronger due to the layer orientation).
The photos show the largest 126mm winder.

They are fun to play around for 5 minutes, but cannot really be used functionally. The wind is too little, the hand gets caught in the blades, and nowhere to grab. This is an upgraded larger version where you can actually use it to cool down!
I also narrowed down the tolerances of the original design to make the fan less wobbly, and the pins to fit more snug.
If spinning too fast, the cover may separate from the case since they are just held together by pins. Use superglue if necessary.

Thingiverse doesn't let me link to the original design using the remix function, for some reason. ---
I loved Joey_3D's original design idea, but I wanted a single file so I could print it with a simple filament change instead of assembling multiple pieces. Inspired by his artwork, I CADed this version. My mom (who has become a huge 3D printing addict) also wanted a ring to it could be easily hung, so I added that as well.
The timing of the filament change depends on your layer thickness. The way to determine the correct place is to slice the design, then use the preview function to find when to insert the filament changes. To be sure the previous layer is completely finished, I suggest you time the filament change after the first layer of the person has been completed, and when the first layer of the frame has been completed.
Happy Printing!"

The print takes about 1.5 hours.
You can check the following properties on this cube:
stringing
bridging (are the bridges over the letter clean, including the large area inside?)
ghosting / ringing
overhangs
dimensional accuracy in all axes
first layer height (is the logo clearly visible on the underside, are there holes in the narrow areas?)
Was the helix printed neatly with a single wall line?
Are there problems with the Z-seam due to the many retraction?
Was the Z printed neatly on the top?
You can also try breaking out the Y, if that is too easy you may have to reduce the cooling or increase the printing temperature.

This remix simply adds a post at the front of the gun for attaching a rubber band in lieu of a spring.
Do note that in cases where a very strong band is used you may need to beef up the infill of the firing pin mechanism. With this mod I've easily launched a tic tac across a small room.
NOTE ABOUT STL FILES: If you've already printed the original TTG2 all you need to print is the left side STL file (TTG_LEFT_RB_V2.stl) to use this mod. The other files have been included in the event someone is starting from scratch.
Test firing video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPLyjFRreI
Update: Uploaded a modified right side as requested for recessed M3 nuts (Right_Side_M3_Nut.stl)
Update2: Updated the left side model slightly to have a smoother band transition from the post to the body of the gun. I was noticing some band wear on my test gun at this point so this should help with that. Removed the original version as it's now redundant.

Please let me know if anyone else gets printing issues going forward with this! Redownloading may help.
I was inspired by the video Hand Tool Rescue posted today on an antique fractal vise design first patented in 1912, US1059545A. This is intended to fit into a large machine vise, but even a conventional bench vise may work as long as the travel is long enough and the jaws can be attached securely. I just put together this first version in a couple of hours using Fusion 360 and I won't have access to my printer until the end of the summer so please let me know if you're able to print it successfully or have any suggestions!
Design Details:
Each rotating jaw is dovetailed together with 0.2mm of clearance and is able to rotate up to 30 degrees without interference, as shown in the second and third pictures. The total assembly height is 25mm and width is 100.6mm. A pair of complete jaw assemblies touching against each other would have a total length of 110mm. Flat and grooved versions of the vise mount are provided, I would guess that the flat version would work best in a machine vise whereas the grooved may work if it is held in place on the jaws of a conventional bench vise (magnets work great for attaching wooden/plastic soft jaws so that may be a good course of action)
Bill of materials (per jaw assembly):
1x Vise Mount (flat or grooved)

Printing:
I would recommend printing each and every part separately, the assembly is included just for reference since printing in place would almost certainly fuse all of the jaws together. A very well-calibrated printer with tight belts must be used to ensure accurate form, and each part should be printed vertically facing the same way (as they would be arranged in the assembly) to ensure dimensional differences between axes don't throw things off. Printing one Jaw D and one Jaw C would likely be enough to see if the fit is satisfactory before printing the rest of the assembly. Support material would be necessary but only for the dovetail. Parts can then be carefully cleaned and sanded/filed to fit. The jaws do not lock into the slots at this time as I wanted to keep the design simple."

It has been specifically designed to house an Emisar D4 and Emisar D4v2 flashlight (sans pocket clip) but can accommodate any flashlight with a cylindrical portion 25 mm or smaller in diameter and 51 mm or larger in length. The mount works best with shoulder straps approximately 46 mm wide and 2 mm thick, though there is a bunch of wiggle room. When used with an Emisar D4, this mount allows for full access to the switch and battery compartment without having to remove the flashlight from the mount. There is also minimal to no contact with the head of the flashlight to allow for maximum airflow.
You will need the following hardware for this build:
6 binding barrels and screws for ¼” thick material
6 neoprene washers for ¼” screw size
Miscellaneous strips of craft foam, rubber sheet, or other similar thin grippy material
I personally used this hardware, though alternatives can be found at your local hardware store:
https://www.mcmaster.com/93121A325/
https://www.mcmaster.com/90133A029/
Instructions
All the pieces can print without supports. You may need to print the bottom and top plate with a skirt for better bed adhesion. I only have PLA material so I printed at 100% infill and annealed the pieces in boiling water so the mount can withstand outdoor use. I’ve found setting the 3D printed pieces in room temperature water in a pot before bringing the water to boiling prevents any kind of warping.
Line the bottom plate’s holes up with the top plate and with your desired strap sandwiched in the center channel. If the strap slides around, glue a rubber or foam strip to one or both of the areas of each piece that come in contact with the strap--anything to grip the strap and keep the mount in place. Even a zig zag of hot glue could work. Insert the lower portion of 2 binding barrels into the 2 center holes in the top plate. You can temporarily screw the corresponding male part into them to hold them in place and keep them out of the way. Secure the top plate to the bottom plate with 4 binding barrels and neoprene washers in the very center between the plates. The neoprene washers are compressed by the barrels and act as lock washers.
Wrap your flashlight in a foam/rubber strip until the light fits snugly inside the top clamp. Secure the top clamp to the top plate with the center binding barrels mentioned earlier. Use 2 neoprene washers to keep these final 2 binding barrels secured. You’re done.
If you need any additional vertical height for the strap or flashlight, you can double up on the neoprene washers at each location. This also increases the locking action of the washers if needed.
The slot in the front of the mount is for small keychains and such and is not weight-bearing. Obviously do not use it to support your body weight. Injury or death may occur.

Use them as keychains, fidget spines, or offbeat decorations.
Two five-vertebrae chains are included, one with a loop at the top and one without. Separate vertebrae are provided to make your own chain as long as you want!
The spines must be printed as oriented, with the spinous processes point up. Changing the orientation of the file will result in improper printing of the inner ball joint between adjacent vertebrae.
The transverse processes that stick out sideways to not need support. Therefore, you only need to support the base of the vertebral bodies and the “loop” if you are printing files with a top loop.
In order to adequately support the curved bottom surface of the vertebral body, try raising the object 3mm off of the build plate, and using the “Line” support in Cura, with the density increased to 40%.
After printing there will be some small adhesions on the inside ball joint and in the facet joints. Just do some gentle spinal mobilization and they will release and move freely. Be sure to let your print fully cool first! If the plastic is still soft, the connector may break when you try to move it.
To build your own, import the number and types of vertebrae that you’ll need to the same origin point within your software of choice. Leave the top vertebrae at the origin, and move the rest of the vertebrae back in increments of 15mm (i.e. move the second vertebrae 15mm, the third vertebra 30mm, and so on.) You can make the spine as long as you want, limited only by the size of your build plate.
Note that these are not anatomically correct! For design purposes, each vertebra is modelled off of the same vertebra, L3. The vertebral foramen has been filled in to provide strength and minimize overhangs, and the articular processes have been considerably reshaped to allow smooth movement.
If you are looking for more anatomically accurate spine models, please check out some of my other models."

My printer is fairly dialed in and print this without a brim too. The inlet is for a standard G3/4"" garden tap. The tap thread outer diameter will measure about 25.5mm. Tap thread is 14 threads per inch.

The inspiration for this comes from a design from a thingiverse design by Tom4everblau - great idea Tom! I drew my own design so i could print without supports, and adjust the number of outlets available.
BTW, you will need to regulate the amount of water coming from the tap. We use an additional valve and a Gardena C1030 plus water timer. We have a small herb garden (the eating type) on our terrace, and we try to deliver total 1.5 liter water a couple of times a day during the summer months."

69,https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4897735,265,cooling fan,Jet Engine Desk Fan V3,"by pittance June 30, 2021","This is the latest (maybe final?) version of my printed desk fan project and it's the first one that is actually a practical fan.
The fan uses a centrifugal compressor to generate airflow, driven by a brushless DC (BLDC) motor that is controlled by a BLDC motor driver and an Arduino nano.
Is the fan quiet? It's not offensively loud (in my opinion) but it is in no way silent; it makes a whining noise from the motor drive and there is clear noise from vibration of the rotor (this will be reduced if your rotor is well balanced). The airflow from the fan is very smooth, however. There is no choppiness that you get from open blade fans and the airflow is very directed so you can have it further away than standard open blade desk fans.
The shroud around the nozzle was supposed to help entrain more air into the jet - I'm not sure it works. The inlet probably should be larger for efficiency but I didn't want to allow a gap big enough easily to let fingers in. With that said: children's fingers might still fit in and while the distance from the intake to the compressor is big enough that people will small enough fingers to get into the gap wouldn't reach the blades I would STRONGLY suggest that you keep this out of reach of children.
Was it aerodynamically designed? No, not at all. I followed some principles in turbomachinery books (mainly this one https://www.pearson.com/uk/educators/higher-education-educators/program/Saravanamuttoo-Gas-Turbine-Theory-6th-Edition/PGM838584.html in a much older version) but this is all eyeballed. If you can actually design compressors maybe you can make it better? At least the stators in this version point the right way, I got them the wrong way around on the first draft.
The motor is an 1806 2300kV motor, like this: https://uk.banggood.com/Flashhobby-BE1806-1806-2300KV-Brushless-Motor-Black-Edition-for-Multicopters-p-946416.html
The brushless motor controller I bought is this one: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/afro-30a-race-spec-mini-esc-w-bec.html it's discontinued now but the new ones seem to be smaller and so should work just as well. The BEC from the motor controller is used to power the Arduino.
The Arduino that controls the motor is like this: https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano I used a perfboard sheet, sockets, pin headers and wires to connect all the parts (see the code for pins to connect).
Power comes from a 12V laptop power supply, you will need to choose the rating of your supply based on your motor controller. Mine was able to take 4S LiPo voltage (16.8V max) so 12V was comfortably in this range. The barrel jack from the supply fits in a socket in the electronics box. This was connected to the motor controller wires with screw terminals which is shonky but effective as long as you don't want to use it with proper connectors again. If you do you might want to find proper connectors that you can solder to the socket.
It uses four Cherry MX-style key switches that I had left from a project, printable keycaps are included but these take a good printer to work well. If you can't print them most standard keycaps should work if you buy standard switches. You can substitute tactile switches or any other momentary switch if you'd rather but the clicky key switches are quite nice. One terminal for all of the switches are connected to a common ground wire. The other terminal of each switch is connected to the pins that are used for detecting button presses. In the Arduino code the internal input pullup resistors are used so connecting the pin to ground when the switches are closed pulls the pins low, the code detects which pin is low and uses that to set the speed. You might need to experiment with your speed controller to find out which speeds work well, mine has low speed set to the lowest speed that the compressor would reliably run at.
Motor cooling seems to be adequate, I've monitored the temperature of the motor with a thermocouple over long periods (1hr+) and the temperature stays comfortably lower than 40degC (101degF, 313K) at all speeds so there should be no problem with PLA mounts getting soft. The motor controller doesn't seem to get hot enough to cause problems, even though the box doesn't have ventilation (you could add this if you wish)."

(I put “simple” in quotes because designing this thing and perfecting it has been anything but simple.)
My goal was to create a ball clock that could be 3d printed relatively easily on an Ender 3 class 3d printer and assembled without too much fuss. I’ve seen and taken inspiration from other ball clocks (particularly 3Dadicto’s clock: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4786491) but they all seemed larger and more complex than what I was going for. This version has only a handful of models that need to be printed (all without supports) and the final assembly is pretty easy.
Additional materials needed:
30x 3/8” ball bearings (at minimum)
10 M3x6 screws (or longer)
1x M2.5 set screw
1x Arduino Nano (or equivalent)
1x DRV8825 stepper motor (or equivalent)
1x Nema 8 (20x20x38mm) stepper motor (the shorter one lacks the necessary torque)
1x 5.5mm x 2.1mm DC power supply jack (or equivalent)
1x 12v power supply with 2.1mm x 5.5mm plug (or equivalent)
(Optional) 1x3"" x 3.5” breadboard PCB
(Optional) Mounting sockets for the Arduino and the stepper driver.
(Optional) JST connectors for the motor and the power leads.
Printing instructions:
None of these models should be printed with supports but it’s pretty important that your printer be reasonably well dialed in. Your build plate needs to be very level because too much skew in the prints can prevent the clock from working. I recommend printing on glass, particularly for the lift wheel, because you want the surface to be as flat and smooth as possible.
WARNING! You will probably want to print the motor housing shell and back and the mounting hub in PETG (or ABS) because the small Nema 8 motor can run hot and I’ve had these motors get hot enough to deform PLA.
Also, when you print the clock base (which can be printed in PLA), you are going to want to print at least the layers that make up the ramp using as low a layer hight as possible (for example 0.12mm) because if the ramp isn’t perfectly smooth, the little balls will occasionally get stuck on the ramp. I used PrusaSlicer’s adaptive printing layers feature and that worked well for me.
All of the other parts can be printed using PLA with normal settings (perhaps 20% infill with 3 perimeters but really anything will probably do the trick.)
Preparation:
Once you’ve printed all of the parts and cleaned them up, you may want to take some time to sand the ramp on the base and make it as smooth as possible. If you don’t do this, balls may occasionally get stuck on the ramp. Take your time and make sure that you test it by lowering a ball VERY slowly behind your finger or a tool to make sure that there are no flat spots or bumps that will cause the ball to get stuck. Despite my best efforts, I still find the last ball in the queue occasionally getting stuck. For this reason, I have suggested you use at least 30 balls, giving you a couple of extra balls in the ramp even when the clock reads 12:59. Having 2 or 3 extra balls ensures that even should one ball get stuck, there will still be one ready to be picked up by the lift. That stuck ball will get knocked loose the next time balls are returned to the queue. Also, I find that if there isn’t enough pressure behind the lowest ball, it may not be picked up by the lifting wheel. Having extra balls in the queue helps ensure that the ball will be picked up every time.
Electronics:
I’ve included a wiring diagram to wire up the Arduino Nano to the DRV8825 stepper motor driver and the driver to the stepper motor. It’s a pretty simple wiring job. Just take your time, making sure you correctly identify all the pins (they may not be in the order you expect) and you’ll get it. A breadboard and JST connectors aren’t necessary but they can really help. I’ve also included a couple of other images showing wiring and pin layouts that can help with this.
WARNING! You will need to make sure you set the proper VREF on the stepper driver before you try to hook it up to the stepper motor. Nema 8 motors need very little current and if you set the VREF too high the motor will run WAY too hot. You could easily melt the motor housing or damage the motor if you skip this step. You’re going to want to set the VREF to 300mV or less. Lower is better. Set it just high enough that the motor doesn’t stall or skip steps. Even if you get it right, your motor will probably run at around 55 to 60c so make sure you’ve printed any part that comes in contact with the motor out of something that won’t deform at those temps. Here’s a page that can help if you don’t know how to set the VREF: https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/Guide/VREF+Calibration+guide+DRV+8825/94
Now would also be a good time to flash the Arduino with the sketch I’ve provided and calibrate the clock. Note that the internal clock on an Arduino is notoriously inaccurate so you WILL need to calibrate if you want the clock to be accurate. You can find instructions in the code. Even calibrated, you’ll probably find that the clock will drift one way or another by a second every day or two since environmental factors such as temperature can affect the Arduino's internal clock. If that’s a problem for you, you’ll need to come up with some way to synchronize the time such as an external RTC module and adjust the sketch to work with it. I haven’t done that because this was good enough for me but if you choose to go that route, leave me a message. I’d love to hear how it goes.
Assembly:
The counting trays should snap in to their cradles with a little encouragement. The hours tray goes on the bottom, the tens tray goes in the middle, and the minutes tray goes on the top. Make sure that they pivot easily. I’ve included a test pivot model that you can print to make sure that your trays will attach and move correctly before you commit to printing the full base. Use it! If the trays fit too snugly then you may want to reprint them with a lower outer wall extrusion or perhaps with a little inverse horizontal expansion. The trays should tilt VERY easily.
Put one ball in each of the little cups on the left side of each of the counting trays. Those balls are counterweights that make sure that the counting trays will reset to their normal orientation (leaning to the left) after they empty their balls. Each of the counting trays also has a hole in the back to receive an M3 bolt. This allows the counterweight to be tuned. You want each tray to stay still (or nearly still) when the first marble rolls on to the tray. If it dips forward more than a jiggle when the ball rolls in, then you’ll want to add weight by backing out the bolt until the tray stays still. Use a longer bolt or perhaps add a nut if you need more weight. The tray should stay tilted to the left even when the front row is full of balls. Once the count is full, the next ball that enters should cause the tray to tip to the right and empty all of its balls. If the tray doesn’t tip to the right with the last ball or if it rebounds before all of the balls have left the tray then you'll need to lighten the counterweight by screwing the bolt farther in or swapping it for a shorter (lighter) bolt. This will take some experimentation but if it’s not tuned right, the clock will drop balls, or perhaps not even work at all.
Next, glue the input tower and the ball return pieces together, using the CAD photos as a guide to where they go. The return ramps should line up. After these two pieces are glued together, you can glue them to the base, just make sure that all of the ramps line up and the balls can easily travel down the ball return ramps and down to the ramp on the base. You’ll want to test before you glue! Tolerances are pretty tight so you may find you need to do some sanding or other post processing to make sure all of the ramps are clear.
Assemble the motor housing with the electronics and the stepper motor. If you’ve used a breadboard to mount the chips, you can use M3 screws to attach the breadboard to the standoffs inside the shell. Mount the power socket to the back and the stepper motor to the inside of the shell so the spindle protrudes through the large circle. Then attach the back to the shell using 3 M3 screws. Note that all of the screws used in this model self-tap. None of the receiving holes are pre-threaded.
Attach the mounting hub to the stepper motor’s spindle using a set screw. The tabs on the hub should face the motor. The hub should be flush (or nearly flush) with the end of the spindle. Make sure that the hub turns freely and that it is as close to perpendicular with the spindle as possible. If it wobbles too much the lift wheel may bind.
CAREFULLY screw the lift wheel onto the mounting hub. NOTE that the threads go in the OPPOSITE direction from normal threads. You will need to turn the wheel COUNTERCLOCKWISE to attach it. This is to keep the wheel from unscrewing itself from the hub during operation. You can print and use the hub wrench to keep the hub from turning while you attach the wheel. Be careful not to over tighten it. Just barely finger tight is tight enough.
Now it’s time to place the motor assembly on the base and slide it up next to the ramps. You will have to experiment with how close to slide it. Here is where having a really level print bed matters the most. Even with an exceptionally well calibrated printer, your wheel will probably be ever so slightly out of alignment and rub up against the model in a few places. You want it to be close enough to the bottom ramp that it picks up the balls one at a time but far enough away that friction doesn’t bind up the motor.
Note that the wheel is designed so that a ball will sit just a little bit proud when it is being carried in the lift pocket. This means that the wheel doesn’t need to be slammed up against the clock. It also means that the balls will be captured more smoothly than they would if the pocket were deeper. You should have a gap of at least a millimeter or two.
Test it for a while. Once you’re happy with the position of the motor housing and the lift wheel, you can secure them in place with a couple of M3 screws.
Setting the Clock and Reading the Time:
The time is read from the bottom up. The bottom tray counts the hours. The top two trays together count the minutes. The middle tray counts the tens digit (one ball added every ten minutes) and the top tray counts the ones digit (one ball added every minute).
Setting the clock is as simple as making sure the lift wheel is in synchronization with the second hand on your reference clock and then putting the correct number of balls in each of the trays so that it reads out the correct time.
A new ball will be picked up at half past the current minute (the 30 second mark) and it will be deposited on the top ramp at the start of the next minute.

INSTRUCTIONS!
this model is pretty simple to assemble thanks to the magnetic construction but with those magnets, you have to be EXTREMELY careful. the 2mm x 10mm magnets are incredibly powerful so make sure to only work with one magnet at a time.
other than that I have added 3mf files for Cura users these files have all the support blockers in place for you :D
electronics! I designed the model to work off of MN21 A23 batteries. all the supplies needed are below
you will need
x1 m3 x 10mm bolt
x6 2mm x 10mm round magnets
x10 3mm x3mm round magnets
x3 5mm white LEDs
x1 5mm red LED
X1 MN21 A23 BATTERY.

This one is rather large so remember to keep the infill as low as you can, since it's front heavy.
Took me about 30 hrs to print this one at 200 microns, but the result, I believe, is worth it.
This mask isn't the best for talking while wearing, but then again wolves don't talk!
The attachment points are hidden on the inside - I used a half a centimeter elastic bands, works OK.
This print can definitely benefit from some padding on the inside, depending on your face.

Printing: No supports needed. Print with largest flat surface down as shown. Higher infill is not required unless you really want to apply a lot of clamp force to hold the fixture in place. I did 25% just to give me a little more safety factor before I accidentally crack it in a vice.

It can transfert 24x36mm slides on a 50x50mm frame.
I use it on my Canon 50mm f/1.8 EF lens.

6 M3x8 bolts + nuts
1 or 2 M3x10 bolts + female threaded inserts M3x5x4
a reverse ring (google: reverse ring or reverse mount with the filter's diameter of your lens)
Setup:
make sure the tube slides: insert the larger in the thinner until they slide smoothly.
fasten all the parts together with the M3x6 bolts/nuts (alternatively you can glue them)

I didn't find anything similar when I searched thigiverse, so I decided to design my own.
Rather than designing an entire vise I instead designed a jaw that can be used as a bench dog, in workmate benches, or proper workbenches.
The peg on this version is 0.77"", 19.6mm, but I've included a 0.75"" 19mm version as well.
All parts were split so that printing could be accomplished without supports. The design is intended to be assembled with screws, but adhesive could work for most parts, except the retaining screws.
A 0.3mm clearance was the basis of design, but the pin sides of the sliding dovetailed parts can be shimmed for printers that can't achieve this precision.
either #4-40 or 3mm screws will work, 3 different screw lengths were used, 9/16""(14mm), 3/4""(19mm) and 1-1/8"" (35mm)
*(Actual size used on pictured assembly was 1.25"" (38mm) but they were slightly too long)
If anyone wants a version with a different diameter, let me know and I can adjust that, or you can make your own to fit, the hole in the main jaw has a 3° taper to guarantee a tight fit.
I designed the peg split so that it prints in the orientation for optimal strength.
For doing real work, this should be printed with several perimeters (I used 4 and it seems quite tough)"

As a self taught hobbyist. I can't say this is correct by any means. but it was all I could come up with. Sizing looks spot on, but of course do check it meets your needs. There is certainly no guarantee this will even function correctly and or line up as I have still lots to learn when it comes to modeling.
Hopefully some one will enjoy making it. So please, if you do take the challenge on, do post some pics of your build. As much as I'd like to create all these models my self, time is the one least thing available to me, so it gives me great pleasure to see others bringing these models to life.

This little fidget toy functions like a mechanical switch from a keyboard. It provides an audible and tactile click when pressed and released. The switch has no electrical contacts: its only purpose is to feel pleasant and make noise.
The print consists of 7 printed pieces and 1 pen spring. Assembly requires a hammer and a block or rag to protect the print.
⚠️ Heads up, hot shot! This is a tricky print. This print has small pieces. These have limited bed contact, but require dimensional accuracy. Your flow rate must be nearly perfect, and you need perfect bed adhesion. Also, if your printer has any elephant's foot, then forget about printing this."

It'll work with coins that are 23mm in diameter or smaller.
All the parts where designed while keeping the limitations of 3d printing in mind. So if you stick to the correct printing orientation, as shown in the picture above, you won't need any supports except for the hopper. Print the turn Handle at 100% infill for increased strength because this part has to withstand the biggest force when the machine is being used.
For those of you who don't have a bigger printer than the standard 220x220mm, I have included a version of the case without the front part that catches the candy. You have to print these two seperately and put together after.
The only thing you need for the assembly are a couple of M3 screws and M3 threaded inserts. I used these ones.
If you have watched the video and still have trouble with figuring out how everything goes together, I suggest you take a look at the CAD model. It is available in the downloadable files. Also I have modeled all the threaded Inserts in the CAD model, so if you are not sure where they go it's easy to figure out from that."

dual 4010 fans with part cooling from both sides

Glue the tiles together and cut out the parts templates.
Stick the templates on the foam board with a temporary glue or sellotape.
Cut out the parts.
Important Note!!: follow the color codes of the lines for cutting as bellow:
4.1. Sold black lines: full cut
4.2. Blue lines: half cut (3mm deep)
4.4. Red lines: these are bevel cutting edge, cut the with angel approaching to the adjacent line (black or blue).
Back the cut foam parts with packing tape on the places you need to bend them to make angle.
Dry-fit the parts and when all is good, glue them.
3D Print the plastic parts, try them on the body of the plane but don't glue them before you paint your plane.
Glue the balsa sticks all around the edges of the body.
Sand the edges and bevel them.
Paint the plane body with acrylic (water base) paint.
Glue the servo tray and the plastic tail part in their places.
Glue the other plastic parts and trims in their places.
Fix the servos and control rods as shown in photos.
Fix the motor, if your motor is longer than Emax RS2205, dont use the spacers or make your own spacer to get the right adjustment.
Fix the ESC and RX and do the wiring.
The CG is around 20mm towards the nose from the mid of the wing leading edge.
Total flying weight with a 4S 1,300 mAh lipo pack is 580 gr.

Designed for these adhesive strips: tesa Powerstrips Large. Should fit almost any tablet and is easily removable.
The wall plate for chargers is meant for chargers that fit inside a standard 60mm junction box as commonly found in Europe, like this: Smart things s24L/A sCharge 12W. The other wallplate has 4mm holes placed 70mm apart for courntersink screws. Its important for both plates that the screws do not protrude over the surface, as they would otherwise contact and scratch the tablet.
Make sure to clean the surfaces well before applying the adhesive strips. Apply the strips to the tablet plate and place the pull tabs for removal over the holes. To align the tablet plate I recommend using something parallel, like a ruler. Route the charging cable through the grooves, then slide the tablet mound down onto the wall plate.
To remove the tablet, just slide it upward and take it off the wall. To remove the strips, pull the tabs through the hole, carefully use pliers if necessary, until the strip is completely released."

I thought it was quite a good concept, although somewhat limited in variety of capability. I found the play of the tray in the original holder either had a little too wide a gap around it making it a little too loose and the overall resolution somewhat low with the edges also seeming a little 'sharp' to the touch.
My inclination is always to fillet the edges in CAD to give the result a smoother or rounder and more ergonimic feel.
So I tried taking the idea a bit further and added more options, such as provision for TF to SD adapters/ WiFi SD cards (e.g. Toshiba's offering).
Seeing as there isn't much room for many TF cards when there's already one or two SD cards in one tray, it was time to add more capacity.
Cue the double and triple tray holders, along with the second and third tray configurations, providing a wider choice of configurations and enabling many more options. The TF wells in the trays are actually deep enough to hold two TF cards each...!
Further options can include different colour coded trays etc. - Very handy for photographers/ those with a plethora of media cards to keep track of them.
If the trays feel somewhat loose or tend to fall out easily, a couple of solutions are to rub a little bar of soap (also lubricates) onto the side edges, undersides of the trays, or even to run a very thin line of CA/ superglue along the side edges (- and let it cure properly before inserting!), just enough to widen the tray(s) to add some more grip.
The method I use if the holder doesn't have an 'upside' indicated on it, is to face the trays towards each other when they're inserted (one at a time!), so that the cards don't all fall out on the floor when the trays are later removed.
Many thanks and congrats to aerobatflyer for the original concept!"

From the original Potty Bank (Thankyou 3dPrintingWorld for the original design!):
I scaled it up 315%
Then used Meshmixer to subtract a 90mm cylinder from where the coin slot is, to accept a standard 1.25lt water/soda bottle.
Smoothed using Meshmixer.
Also made two bottle adapters - one to have the water level at the lower lip, and one for the water mid-way up the lip.
Then made the lid pin.
Notes if you want to make this yourself:
You will need a 400mm cubed print volume! The main body is just under that and all one piece! No supports needed.
I have included the original lid - scale this up by 315% in your favorite slicer program.
You will more than likely need a 2kg roll of white. I used just under 1.5kg for the main print.
The bottle adapters are quite hard to get in, but remember to keep the chamfered bottoms to the back, squeeze the two sides together and push it up from the bottom of the bowl.
Make sure your water bottle is 90mm diameter or slightly less.
Print the pin flat down. Support may be needed for this.
Printed with Spectrum PLA - Polar White - 1.75mm - 2kg Spool
And a wood filament for the lid.
I used 4 walls, 5/6 top and bottom layers, and 5-8% infill.

He is composed of various elements Dreamfinder found in his travels including two tiny wings, large yellow eyes, the horns of a steer, a crocodile's snout, and the childish delight found at a birthday party.
No supports are required. One piece contains built-in supports, an optional part without the built-in supports is also supplied if you want to use your slicer supports (see notes below). If you have the proper filament colors, no painting is needed.

Printing and assembly tips
Printing tips
1 - No supports are required. The head piece is presented with built-in supports as well as an optional part without supports if you want to use your slicer supports. Due to the curves for the area that requires supports, printing at a lower layer height will produce a better print. Using slicer supports with the lower layer height is also a viable option for a cleaner print.
2 - There are some pieces that may need brims or rafts, use your discretion. When setting up my prints I prefer to be conservative, especially since the base of many parts are hidden when inserted into another part. For the smaller parts, a good first layer is helpful.
*I used brims on:
All orange parts (a bit overkill)
3 - Figment's colors vary. My wife chose the colors that matched the cartoon look. She specifically bought two rolls of filament from CookieCad to get this color combo.
4 - The claws_hand are quite small and there is a good chance of losing some when assembling the model. You may want to print extras to avoid the dreaded 'I dropped one and can't find it' syndrome.
5 - When removing parts from the printer bed, it's a good idea to place left/right parts into separate containers to help with the assembly process.
..
Assembly tips:
1 - Take your time gluing the model together and enjoy the process.
2 - I used E6000 sticky craft glue to put this model together. The sticky glue allows more time to position the parts than a fast drying superglue. I have 'fat fingers' and a shaky hand, so the sticky glue works out best for me, especially with small pieces. Just remember to leave enough time for the glue to set before combining too many parts.
3 - Be sure to fully clean off the first layer of each claws_hand, even sanding down at an angle a bit. Depending on the quality of your print, the holes for the claws may need to be cleaned out as well. Everything fits, providing the claws bases are clean.
4 - The built-in supports are a bit tight. There are handles attached to the supports for easy removal. As noted above, due to the curve, this area is not as smooth printed at .2mm as I would have preferred.
5 - Glue the head_spike into the head and then glue that to the body. I tried the other way around and it was not as convenient.
6 - One side of the spikes is longer than the other for inserting into the body part. Orient this longer side into the deeper part of the slot in the body. It should be obvious, however pay attention as the direction changes as the curve of the body changes.
6 - Both the orange parts for the tail and horns can accidentally be put in incorrectly. Refer closely to the pictures and diagram for the correct positioning (even I had to refer to my own diagram!). Modeling for no supports sometimes results in situations like this.
7 - Refer to the assembly diagrams in the pictures section as well as the uploaded pictures for putting the model together. The model is meant to be glued.
Do not hesitate to ask questions, feedback is essential to making better models."

ostbit wasn't able to hold my pans, since it's mainly designed to hold plates. but i was using it to hold pan lids. it does a great job of organization. it doesn't crumble, you don't need to shuffle all to pick one etc. so i decided to apply the same idea for pans.
bases have 2 options. small base has 45 mm separation perfect for small to medium size pans. bigger base has 55-60 mm separation (60 where it connects to another base, 55 between each other)
you can connect indefinite bases with each other.
stick piece connects lateral pieces and becomes the vertical elements that holds the pans upright. vertical opening is snug since it must stay put, i recommend hammering them in.
basic print option is: 10 sticks + 2 small bases
you can modify as you wish with different combinations. i also added the .skp file, so you can modify even further if you want. enjoy."

New 2.0 Dock should be out tonight or tomorrow, just finishing final printing, features of 2.0, Refined gopro mount for more clearance and better nut attachment, thinner cap base, thinner holder, holder has closer tolerances and new design with front faceplate and you will be able to print off inserts to fit smaller phones, new boxed end for gluing in a USB charger connector turning it into a full dock. Link will be posted here when the new thing goes online.
2.0 version here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4892827
Okay, I have seen cupholder mounts in stores for 60 bucks, I wanted to make something on my own. I am currently printing this out, consider this a work in progress.
Key features it needed:
simplest print
strong enough to last
adjustable (rotation and angle)
some cable management
Used common or simple to get parts
this is a 3 piece assembly, can be glued or left adjustable, rudimentary explanations in the photos. Fits a phones sized 160x85x13 mm (Basically a moto g4+ with case).it can fit smaller, use hairbands around the side tabs to keep it in place or make and print out adapters to accommodate smaller. I may design other slides later.
I Updated the slide to be more rounded in places while adding strength to make it easier to hit side mounted buttons.
Explanations from the bottom up :
Cup Base: the base is notched in the bottom to run a usb cable down the side of the cup holder (I should have left enough room for this) the top has a large center hole, this is for the cable to come up through to the phone itself, I will add a cable cap for this later. the 2 long holes are so the top can secure to it at most angles and kind of rotate securely it's designed for M3 bolts, but some sanding may be needed. As mentioned you can just glue this to the cap. There is also a new noturn variant so you can just bolt it together for one solid unit.
Cap: large hole for running the cable, 2 small holes for the adjustable rotation, using m3 bolts, will be a tight fit so the sliding happens underneath or file them out to loosen them, 2 gopro style mounts are here to attach the slide. use standard go pro hardware for tightening, and I would recommend 4-5 walls for printing to make it solid. The nuts are not really needed, file the holes for the bolt section to taste for a fit without using the nuts
Slide: holds a moto g4+ with case or similar, the side grips do not need supports however it will be like the part above. your choice. the slides can be used for an elastic if you want more securing of the phone,
This design allows some cable management and storage as when you run the cable into the cup section excess can be left there and just the amount needed at the top. the cable is not going to be twisted by the rotation as there are natural stops. the gopro mounts allow you to se the best tilt angle. if you find it moves too much in the actual cup holder you can put a wide rubber band at the level of the cupholder grips.
Hopefully this helps someone out. This is about a 10 hour print with multiple layer heights and walls.
Updates:
June-23-2021:
Updated the slide to 1.4, this levels the gopro type support for easier printing
June-22-2021:
Added Short noturn Cup, This removes the sliding element and leaves the 2 m3 sized holes to attach to the cap. no bolts are required, the holes snug up nicely with the m3 bolts. No supports are needed for the slide now. (but you can add them if you want)
June-21-2021:
This is now fully tested and working, :) Photos in the makes and on here. I do recommend the v1.2 cup that is shorter. but other than that it worked to my satisfaction :)
Slide 1.4: Updated the slide to a slightly smaller size, seems too much tolerance (1.4 slide)
June-20-2021
Slide 1.2: Replaces the slide with a new version that gives a nice strong contoured notch, I also rounded the side supports and bottom support better.
Cup 1.2: Turns out some cup holders are tapered going down by about 5mm. While the original version will still sit and set nicely it puts it up higher than I had designed, as such I have introduced this new version to give a choice if you want it down lower (by about 15mm) this will still give lots of grippy friction to your holder provided the holder is the current standard in side (85mm or so)"

I made this to incorporate an old halo 3 mountain dew I have been saving for a project as well as to add a phone charger that my new desk setup was missing. I wanted to make this look like it would sit on someone's desk way into the future of someone who was working a office job for the UNSC and the fusion coil was the power supply for their phone or anything else they would need to plug in. Of course the mountain dew can wouldn't really be lore accurate but I wanted to have fun with it especially since I have held onto it all this time. Plus the can is totally optional and could be swapped with something else like a yellow printed cylinder I have as the hollow can replacement model.
You can check out the build video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFyLqzJ14Qs
Now onto putting this all together.
I made this all in Fusion 360 and was printed with a CR-10s. The Phone Stand is not the same as the one in the video and is meant to just hold a wireless qi charger if you want it to actually charge your phone. I did this to avoid confusion and make it more available and user friendly. Another thing that isn't a huge deal but annoyed me is that the legs for the fusion coil are not perfectly symmetrical but only by a very small, almost unnoticeable amount. I'm not quite sure how that happened on my end but after seeing how slight of an issue it was It wasn't worth the change in the model for how much it would of messed up other pieces.
The Hollow can replacement model is a hollow cylinder meant to take the place of the can and will fit into the center of the fusion coil. I also cut a hole into it if you would like to run lights inside as well. The Qi Charger holder model I have is made to specifically to hold the Qi Charger I have in the link below I'm not sure if It would work for any other types.
I realize this whole thing is a lot different from the one I made and the main reason for that is that I had to make several changes after all the prints were out of the printer to get them to work with the motor and the way I made my connections. However If your up to the challenge and want to add the motor and light to work by placing your phone on the stand or even remix this whole model I would love to see it.
All of the pieces should go together pretty easily and should be pretty clear on what goes where. There may need to be some slight sanding to make everything fit properly depending on your print settings but other than that you should be good to go. If you have questions feel free to ask and I would love to hear any comments good or bad on the model so It will help me in the future!

This is a funnel with some features I think help do its job better. The first being a longer nozzle, while this does not help to funnel the water it helps the funnel stay in the throat of the bottle and help keep it from falling, freeing both hands. The more notable feature are the air ducts that run along the side all the way to the top of the funnel. This helps air from inside the bottle escape by preventing the funnel form a seal with the throat of the bottle (or whatever the receptacle is). No matter how deep the funnel sits, there will never be a seal that prevents the liquid from flowing in at the fastest speed. This new version has wider ducts that allows more air to pass through and is overall much thinner with less wasted material.

***Update 18th July 2021
A 50% scaled-down version has been requested and uploaded as two STL files ""Star Wars 50% Shells.stl"" and ""Star Wars 50% Diffusers.stl"".
The scaled-down version is 181mm in total width which would fit on most printers and can be printed in place. No glue is required to stick the letters together.
If you are looking for an easy print, go with the 50% scaled-down version as it would be much easier than the full-sized version. The total print time of the scaled-down version is approx. 10 hours only.
.Step file is included if you would like to make any changes or have a look at how the whole thing should look like when printed.
This design was inspired by the YouTube channel ""Duke Doks"". The link to their specific video on how to design the letters is attached.
Each letter of this design is listed as a separate file as I wanted to create a big lamp that could be hung on the wall. There is a total of 4 screw holes on the back in order to be hung on the wall.
If you feel that this lamp is too big or you'd like to make it even bigger ;) you can scale each letter directly from your slicer. This should make it quite easy to change the size according to your needs.
At 100% scale, the dimensions of the lamp are:
Length: 165mm
Width: 370mm
Height: 30mm
Assembly Instructions:
Use regular super glue in order to stick the letters together.
Run the LED strip starting from the last letter ""S"", running all the way through all the letters and ending back at the S. The strip can bridge from under the W (of Wars) to S1 (of Star) from underneath. I recommend using the right-hand rule strategy like in Mazes ;)
Fit back the white printed diffusers to their respective locations over the LED strip and Voila!
Print Instructions:
Please make sure you print the correct letter for each word. Files with number 1 are the letters that belong to the word ""Star"", while files with number 2 are letters that belong to the word ""Wars"". R1 and R2 are different and neither should be duplicated.
All parts require no support. I recommend using low-quality layer heights such as 0,28mm with high speeds (I have gone up to 70 mm/s). As long as you find the right balance to you that does not sacrifice too much quality for speed.
For the diffusers, I used regular white colour filament from GiantArm. I would recommend having at least 3-4 bottom layers so that the LED lights are diffused well, rather than seeing spots everywhere.
Important Notice
Please note that the CAD files have been slightly modified compared to the printed model displayed in the pictures, to improve the overall design aesthetics and ease of assembly."

Caps are mounted by folding the back part of the cap inwards and sliding the top “nob” of the hat in the circular part of the rack. The arm will hold up the hat and prevent it from falling out of the rack.
The Cap Rack consists of 3 parts.
A top part (female dovetail on bottom)
A middle part (male dovetail on top, female dovetail on bottom)
A bottom part(male dovetail on top)
I you only need 2 hat rack spaces, you can easily print only the Top and Bottom design and click them together. If you want, for example 8 hat spaces. You can print; 1 top part, 6 middle parts and 1 bottom part. If you buy any new caps, don’t worry! You can easily print a new middle part and add it to the rack.
The screw hole has a diameter of 10mm, so that it the maximum screwhead size that can be used.
The result is in the photo’s is printed on Ender 3 with Glass bed.
Used a 0,4mm nozzle, with a layer height of 0,2mm. Infill used is 25% Hex.

Modified the Parametric Rugged Box by TheSameNameTwice to hold 48 AA batteries. They have an AA holder as well but it holds fewer batteries and isn't staggered. I chose 48 because that's the size of AmazonBasics AA batteries I usually purchase.
Note that I also modified the original Parametric Rugged Box's hinge mechanism to make it easier to install whilst maintaining the rigidity. Also trimmed down the locking mechanism so it doesn't feel like it'll break every time I close the box.
I added a file aa_sample.stl that has a few AA holes that I recommend testing with to make sure your AA's will fit into the holes in the box. I've found that some AA batteries are a little thicker than others for whatever reason.
Printing
Nothing should need supports. Make sure you're printing the bottom part, bottom side against the build plate, and the top part, top side against the build plate.
I printed with a 0.2mm layer height with 15% gyroid infill, came out more than strong enough. I used Prusament Galaxy Silver PLA on my Prusa i3 MK3S+ printer.
What I used:
Software: PrusaSlicer 2.3.0
Printer Used: Prusa i3 MK3S+
Supports: No
Adhesion: Skirt
Layer Height: 0.2mm
Infill: 15% Gyroid
Filament Used: PLA Galaxy Silver by Prusament
How I Designed This
I wanted mine to be more dense than the current remix for the original Parametric Rugged Box so I went down a rabbit hole looking for the densest organization of circles within a rectangle. Ended up finding Packomania which gave me the exact coordinates to place each circle at. Navigate to Circles in rectangles with variable aspect ratio and choose 48 to see the layout. Pretty interesting stuff."

It's not specifically either scale as these boats, when built by hand, vary in size but not so much in proportion, so this can easily be scaled up or down (to a point) and still be a valid boat. If you scale height and width only it might become more of a rowing skiff, and if you scale the overall size it could be a dinghy rather than a full-on boat.
As it stands, the boat is 15' (4.5m) long in 1/87 scale or 13' (4m) in 1/76 scale.
I've included some seats, but the seats will change with the size, and you may be better off making some yourself from 0.5mm styrene.
Included in the files is a water base. Real boats float, and when they sit in the water they inevitably displace some. This is a problem with so many model layouts I've seen, where the boats sit 'on' the water rather than 'in' it. The solution is obviously to use a waterline hull model, which is fine on larger boats, but fails when small boats are involved as you can normally see all the way down into the hull. To remedy this, there is a waterline base in the files. The idea behind this is to print it out, and then cut a matching hole into the water on the layout, and glue it in place. You can then apply any paint/silicone/water effects you want in and around it and be assured that the boat will fit nicely and sit at the correct level in the water when you're done.
To paint the model, first spray it a yellow ochre colour, then brush paint it with Van Dijk Brown OIL PAINT (needs to be oil paint). Then rub the oil paint off with tissues and cotton buds, this will leave you with the rich wooden colour in the photos. If you have carefully sanded off the print lines and sanded in a woodgrain texture to the planks, this will show up very nicely at this point. Best to do the oil paint in patches as it soaks in a bit whilst you go.
It could also probably be printed larger, but it's easier to ignore print lines on a smaller scale. I also haven't boolean combined any of the components so if you want to smash it up a bit, it should be possible to delete and cut planks, ribs etc to make a reasonable wrecked boat."

I approached him about releasing these for free on Thingiverse, so some good could come from his failed project, and he agreed.
I have not printed all of these files myself, nor can I make changes to them if something is wrong. I'm simply posting them for him.

288,https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4899434,67,,Fractal Vice Version 2,"by Billzilla July 03, 2021","This is (should be) an improved version over the earlier one. Instead of the dovetail connections between the pieces I've drawn it with simple 90° & flat surfaces that'll print more cleanly & the supports will (should) also be removed easier.
To give enough space to make it all fit together I've made the sliding connections between the pieces stick proud of the outer radius of the semicircular parts. It's not as tidy as doing it with the dovetail sliding connections draw inverse to that, but it'll work better on a 3D printer.
On the mounting bracket I've added four of 10 mm holes in case anyone actually builds one and wants to bolt it down onto a bench. I will be drawing a sliding frame that'll finish off making it into a complete & otherwise conventional vice. That'll happen hopefully soon.
You'll need fourteen 3 mm bolts to lock the smaller parts together, and trim them all to the correct length so when tightened they don't rub on the far side of the groove in the larger part that they slot into. One 4 mm bolt is needed for the largest semicircular part, again trimmed to length. Sticking out about 1.5 mm to 2 mm should be fine for all of them.
Designing this machine in CAD has very much made me aware of what an impressive job the original designer of the vice did. No CAD, just paper & pencil, and a very clear vision of how it all worked together. And over a century ago as well.
As per the previous version, if you want a real metal one, please buy one from the link below.
https://fractalvise.com
Update!
I've drawn up the bench mount for it. You'll need a printer that can print parts about 240 mm long. I made the mount in two main pieces so you can print one of a reasonable size, so you can use it for pretty much anything you like. If there's a need for a wider opening I can easily change it but you'd need a larger printer for that.
All of the holes are designed so that if the threaded section of the bolt goes into it, the bolt will cut its own thread into the plastic. There's a mix of 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, and 10 mm bolts needed. They will all need to be trimmed to the correct length.
I've designed the mount so you can put the crank handle on either end. In the link below -
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001436323597.html?spm=a2g0s.8937460.0.0.fdb42e0epJ28xU
That's the ACME threaded rod I designed it for 10 mm diameter and 2 mm pitch. Cut it so that there's about 40 mm sticking out both ends of the body of the vice. It'll run in a 10mm ID, 19 mm OD, 5 mm thick ball bearing that pushes into each end.
Get a 10 mm washer to fit over the threaded rod at both ends, maybe get a few to act as spacers if needed.
Use a grinder to grind a flat onto the threaded rod. (see the crank handle for how big to make the flat, the handle should slide snugly onto the end of the threaded rod with no play)
Then drill a 4 mm hole in the rod to match the hole in the crank handle, then tap the thread into the metal rod. Do that both ends if you want to use the crank handle on both ends.
If you only want the crank handle at one end, just use a plain split pin as close as you can to the washers, to reduce freeplay in the winding action.
I might actually print this myself and if so, I'll post a bunch more photos."

This plant doesn't!
The one gigant leaf if providing most of the energy the plant needs and at the same time shields roots and branches from radiation. Out in the wild single ones can be found. However, they tend to grow in groups and circles which sometimes look like oversized satellite dishes. Research on this matter is ongoing. (So is the 3d modelling of additional variants. ;-))
Hope you like it. Have fun!
Btw: Like my last few models, this one also features a small hole on the bottom. This can come in handy when painting the plant. This way it can be turned into a plant on a stick which makes holding it a lot easier.)
One last thing: This is a fairly easy print - you could add some support below the main leaf. However, I printed it without which also worked out just fine with 0.06 mm and 0.15mm layer height.

The emblem on the back, I couldn't decide which way to have the iconic Bad Batch emblem verted or inverted, so have loaded both so you can choose which one you like best. Happy printing Cheers Jace
Shoulder pads loaded 11/07/2021 with two options of the insignia embossed inverted and external. Loaded front and side views of the shoulders, chest and back pack on 6 foot 4 Wrecker pic for consistency. Currently working on the forearms! : )
Bicep & Forearms loaded 14/07/2021. As much as I'm trying to make this as accurate to the Wrecker character as possible, there is still no certainty that it will fit directly onto a human sizes male figure, as in regards to the forearms ""like the armor on a storm trooper"" will likely need to be split in half as I suspect you wont be able to get you hand out the bottom. Or slip the Chest Armor over your head. Food for thought if you do look at take this project on in it's infancy, cheers Jace
Torso and bottom added 17/07/2021 although I'm thinking a type of fabric would be better for the abdomen and or torso so to create flexibility. So worth thinking about before printing those pieces. I'm hoping the bottom / pelvis piece can be just slipped up on like pants but may need to be split into two parts. Hand covers thighs and calves to come, Cheers Jace"

Warning!
When printed on FDM printer, model may take an estimated 6-and-a-half days to print at a 0.15mm layer height with 5% infill. Model may take up to 1kg of filament.
Modified from Google's 3D warehouse model.
Parts come together with glue. Inserts have been added to aid with aligning the pieces perfectly.
Recommended Print Settings
The displayed example was printed using the default 0.15mm layer height quality setting on Prusa Slicer. Infill was 5% and a gyroid pattern. The inserts were printed at 0.3mm layer thickness to reduce time since those parts were not aesthetic-critical components.
Inserts come in two varieties: 0.2mm offset tolerance and 0.3mm. If your printer is not fine-tuned for high-tolerance prints, it is recommended to use 0.3mm offset inserts. 0.2mm offset tolerance inserts fit perfectly into the holes for displayed model.
When slicing, you don't need to use supports! Just print as-is.
Model Dimensions
Length: ~14.5in or ~36.8cm
Width: ~8.5in or ~21.6cm
Height: ~4.5in or ~11.4cm

The same effect occurred with the outlet. Therefore, I designed a stabilizer for both, so that the hoses arrive straight at the pool wall. This also relieves the pool liner.
Very easy to print, but because of the cavities always with support. As infill I chose only 25%. I used PETG from Extrudr. I would always choose PETG because PLA deforms too quickly in the sun. BDP would certainly work as well."

Print Instructions:
Set your lift height higher than the level of resin in your vat.
Put supports in only where you can easily remove them from the bottom.
Use your normal print settings for all other aspects.
Post Processing:
Clean the print throughout and remove the supports.
Make sure to get cleaning solution in the dragon thoroughly.
Let the cleaned print dry and make sure any stuck resin inside of the dragon comes out.
Cure the print.
Finishing:
Wet sand thoroughly at increasing grit incriments (I used 220-320-400-600-1000-1200-1500-2000-2500)
Wash off the print and let it dry.
Use a clear coat to make the print transparent. I used 3 coats of Minwax fast-drying spray-on polyurethane. You can also use a liquid clear coat (I recommend dunking it but don't let the clear coat get in the model.)

I often just need 2 to 3 thread wide prints to see if the bed is right.
So the patterns have 4 thread wide arms, which is printed without any surface printing.
That saves a lot of time.
Also sometimes you just want to check a smaller area and not the hole bed, when you just need one small print in the center of the bed. Therefor the smaller patterns.
Next to the .stl files, I also already made .gcode files.
Available Sizes:
-60 mm
-80mm
-100mm

Available Layer Thicknesses:

-0,20mm
Printing times:
-60mm -> ~ 1 min
-140mm -> ~ 5 min
-200mm -> ~ 7 min
-290mm -> ~ 12 min
The .gcode is made with the standard settings of Cura for a Ender 3 Pro. I also deactivated the skirts to save printing time.
Watch out:
I am not able to test 230mm, 260mmm and 290mm because I don't have a wide enough bed.
I hope you find this useful.

The air flow is pulsed and vibrates the lens and makes a noise.
This simple device filters those pulses out to smooth the airflow, if that's what you want. Pulsed air may be better than smooth airflow?
It works by directing the air into a large closed volume, in this case a 2l pop bottle. The pressure pulses go into the bottle where they're absorbed into the large volume. Another port lets the air out at a constant pressure, hardly any pressure variation.
Want some puffing, use a smaller bottle.
The thing here is simply a bottle top with 2 barbed couplings for the flexible hose between the pump and the laser. There are two versions, the first has slightly longer threads because it has a flat inner surface designed for a cork (or similar) gasket to seal tightly. You don't really need this for your laser because the static pressure is low and a bit of air leaking isn't important.
The second version has a small conical sealing ring where the top of the bottle is supposed to seal, it's also not as deep since it doesn't need a gasket. It seals reasonably well but not nearly as well as a proper bottle top. The barbs are more barb-like and the internal spigot also has a small ring to help retain a soft flexible tube.
It could also be used in a different way to filter dirty air, attach a pipe to the inside tube long enough that the end is submerged and it will bubble through the water in the bottle before it goes out the other air port.
Its easy enough to make this device with some hotmelt and a pop bottle to but it will be slightly more tricky to get it to fit because a pop bottle lid is so small. Use a larger mouth bottle if you want to do this, a mason jar for example.
Place this filter near the laser so that the pipe's frictional resistance to airflow helps filter the pulses from the pump, this is basically a first order low pass filter, to those who understand electronics it will make perfect sense.
3D printed parts are NOT as air/watertight as you may think, if you want it to be completely air or watertight the you should paint it with nail varnish to seal the porous 3D printed material.
Print with the thread side up, as shown in the picture, and use supports only touching the bed, don't want to fill the internal plumbing with support material!
It leaks air because printed parts are porous"

This is the first switch case I am posting publicly, please give suggestions on how to improve it, and if there is demand for more designs I may make and upload more.
This case is designed to fit the switch nearly perfectly without any added padding. Depending on demand, I may edit the case in the future so people can add more space for padding if desired.
I’m not exactly sure what the tolerances are, but parts of this print may not work properly if your printer isn’t accurate enough.
It is also designed to be 100% 3d printed, and only needs some glue for construction. (super glue has worked well for me)
Print Instructions:
Everything is printed with 0.2mm layer height.
A print bed size of at least 246mm in x or y direction to print is required.
Depending on demand, I may attempt to design an entirely different switch case for smaller printers.
Bottom:
May need supports for the latch in the front that catches the clip.
Top & Design:
For Multi-material printers you should be able to import both the top and design together the same way you would with any other multi-material print.
For Non-multi-material The rectangles are there to help align both the top and design parts in the center of the build plate. It should be possible to print the design first, then print the top over it to get strong adhesion of the 2 parts. Make sure z-hop is turned on and has at least 0.4mm z-hop height, and for printers that use a pinda sensor you'll have to make sure that is left high enough to not catch on the design when printing the top. It should also work just to print the design and top completely separate then glue the design in after both have finished, though I have not tested that and your results may vary.
Stand:
No supports should be needed to print this part, though it may come out better or worse depending on how good your bridging settings are. Mine are not particularly good at the moment.
Clip:
There are 2 clip options, one has a hole to charge the switch through when the case is closed, the other does not.
Axle:
You'll need to print 2 of these.
If you are having trouble getting the axle to stick to the build plate, try rotating it 10 degrees or so and printing it with supports. Though the axles may need some sanding if done that way.
If you want to replace the axle with your own metal axle, they are 2.6mm in diameter, and 51mm long.
Axle Cap:
print 4 of these.
Assembly Instructions:
Put the top and bottom pieces together and attempt to put the 2 axles in the back. If it’s too hard to put the axles in or if the case creaks when opening it, take the axles back out and sand. Depending on the quality of the print the outside of the hinges may also need some sanding to eliminate all creaking. Once axles fit in and creaks are eliminated to your desire, glue the axle caps to either and of both hinges to prevent the axles from slipping out.
With the axles in place, close the case and attempt to fit the clip into place, it should fit so there are no gaps in between the case and clip. If the clip doesn’t seem to fit properly, sand the standoff of the clip until it does, then glue into place."

I wanted to remake this to improve the Digits on the top, which I find if embossed rather than debossed makes for a better / clearer end result. You can choose to print the text layers in another colour or do as I did and simply ink the top faces with a contrasting colour sharpie.
STL & Solidworks native part file formats attached should anyone wish to alter / improve to suit their needs then feel free :)
Printing:
Part is 5mm thick total. But if you print first 4mm at higher speed, and then reduce to a slower setting for the last 1mm then this will make sure the digits get printed well.
I used 0.25mm layer height throughout, medium part cooling fan, zero raft, zero support, and recommend 2x perimters, and 3x solid infill (top & bottom layers)."

This is my project of a Big 3D Printed 81:1 Herringobne Gearbox that is designed to work like a servo. Gear ratio between gears is 3:1 and there are 4 levels of gears which gives a reduction of 81 to 1. To power this servo I used an electric motor from my skateboard and together with this gearbox it really is strong . On my tests I achieved about 15Nm of torque , but it should be able to easily do much more.Keep in mind that this servo has some backlash and isn't very precise but it is a great proof that you can make servo out of anything. Watch my video to learn more.
Here I am giving you all the files, including .step and .f3d so feel free to remix and use them as you want.
Parts to print:
1x Top Gear
3x Gear 39/13t
1x Motor Gear
1x Keyway
1x Bottom
1x Top
1x Case
1x Servo Arm
1x Potentiometer Gear
Parts list:
2x 8mm steel shaft 120mm long
1x Bearing 6908
3x Bearing 608
5x Bearing 688
4x Short M4 screws to mount the motor
6x Long M5 screws and nuts fto mount the servo arm
Some additional screws to hold the whole case together
1x Brushless Motor in my case Flipsky 6374 (You can use any motor you want but first check if it will fit correctly)
1x Vesc
1x 10S battery (you can use any battery that works with your motor)
Also to make it work like a servo you need:
1x Arduino
1x Rotary Potentiometer
1x RC transmitter and receiver or a servo tester
All the arduino codes that I used in my video can be downloaded as a zip file

Multiple design features are incorporated in the Opticon Test Geometry that will display the capabilities and limitations of the selected Additive Manufacturing Technology. The round structure is divided in pie sections of 45 degrees. Each section is dedicated to a certain type of lattice or family of features.

Combine this parts to get one box:

* Lid XX - 2,5
* Two Drawers OR Drawer_deep
* One Top drawer
Assembly
- Use 2x M2.5x18 screws to connect lid to body, best are socket head screws.
- Designed to be printed from PLA, but if you have problem with lid clip durability, use PETG. It is easy print without supports.
- Use Lid xxx - 2,5. It is default lid with holes for M2,5 screws.
- If screws are loose and can't cut thread into the lid, use Lid xxx 2,4. It has smaller holes for the screws.
Notes
- I print Lids with PLA except silk ones. These are too fragile, or I can't print them correctly for this use.
- If possible, use M2.5x16 or M2,5x18 screws with socket head.

This is the fifteenth expansion parts kit meant to complement my original Star Trek Constitution Class Parts Kit. This kit includes my attempt to depict the Federation class from the Franz Joseph Starfleet Technical manual, and some related designs.
See my Thingiverse Profile for the full list of parts kits I’ve released so far. All parts are meant to be cross-compatible between kits for your kitbashing enjoyment.
This thing contains combined ship STLs. In addition it contains two zip file containing the parts STL files used to build the combined ships and the Blender files used to create those parts:
FedDN-blender-files.zip – The Blender source files used to generate the ship and part STL files.
FedDN-parts-stls.zip – STL part files.
This kit supports the following variant ship classes:
Federation class dreadnought
The original TOS-era three-nacelle dreadnought from Franz Joseph’s 1975 Starfleet Technical manual. Images from this book including, including diagrams of the Federation class, appeared briefly in the background of Star Trek II and III, making it arguably screen-canonical!
Federation class dreadnought (refit)
This fanon movie-era version upgrades the Federation to use styling consistent with the refit constitution. There are many versions of this design floating around the internet, but I’ve never been completely happy with any of them, particularly if they stray too far from the original FJ design. I’ve tried to synthesize a version that I like, inspired from several different sources (most prominently Jackill’s and Brad R. Torgersen’s versions), but keeping a number of key features from the original.
Star Empire class dreadnought
This model is my take on the titular ship from Diane Carey’s 1986 TOS novel, “Dreadnought!“ It’s a book I’m not particularly fond of but the ship itself has interesting features, most noticably an octagonal saucer. The design is highly speculative on my part, because all we’ve really got to go on is a highly stylized (and admittedly pretty cool) Boris Vallejo book cover.
Triumph class light dreadnought (remix)
These kits are meant to make kitbashing easier, and the Triumph class is a basic little example to celebrate real-world plastic model kitbashers. The design is a combination of Constitution and Federation class parts and was originally constructed from existing physical model kits by John Payne. In addition to the Federation class saucer, this model uses modifiied parts from my original Constitution Class Parts Kit.
Notes on scaling and working with Blender
My target scale for all source files and output STL files is 1:1000. Although these files have not been extensively tested through printing, they are intended to be resized to match common modelling and miniatures scales.
Target scale Scale STL files to: Notes
1/3900 0.25641026 FASA miniature scale
1/3788 0.26399155 ADB Starline 2400 scale

Blender is free, which to be honest was the primary factor in my decision to learn it. There are many fine video and text tutorials available online if you're interested in learning more. See the Blender fundamentals tutorials playlist to get started.
You can use File -> Import -> Stl (.stl) and File -> Export -> Stl (.stl) to load or save STL files in blender.
Note: These kits were built using Blender 2.9.
Post-processing STL output
Although all of the STL files included have been tested as valid watertight meshes, joining the parts together and exporting new STL files can introduce small errors that may cause issues with slicing programs. I recommend any STL files you create are checked using a program like Netfabb Basic free edition. Doing a simple ""Close All Holes"" repair has fixed most of the issues I've run into so far. If you do run into issues with mesh quality, please let me know.
Parts list
The following lists provide a summary of the included parts. Parts are included in the ZIP file FedDN-parts-stls.zip.
For the majority of items, the mesh origin has been set so that when you import these objects into your 3D editor of choice, they are positioned as they would be on the sample ships provided.

Didn't want to bring along a big and heavy blower for my camping trips. This one uses a small dc motor powered by a 5v USB. The one shown in my video is using 10k rpm but it works much better with a 20k rpm motor or higher. The impeller was designed to fit on an 11 teeth gear. I use plastic gear because the motor shaft will be too hot for PLA to withstand. How firm the bed can be inflated depends very much on the power of the dc motor but for this application, it's just enough for my little kids' weight.

Description
We all love the game series Lemmings. So here they are ready to conquer your territory, well, if they survive.
Customizer
You can select a Lemming and change its sizes and bevels according to your personal preferences.
Use OpenSCAD
As the Thingiverse customizer has some issues. It's better to use OpenSCAD instead.
Download and install: OpenSCAD version 2021.01 or newer
Download: The *.scad file of this model.
Start OpenSCAD and open the *.scad file in it.
Open the customizer via the menu ""Window/Customizer""
Now you can configure the model.
Export your STL file
If you're done with your model settings, you can export the STL file:
Render the mesh by pressing the F6 key.
Wait until the rendering is finished. This might take some minutes.
Export the STL file by pressing the F7 key.
Optionally save your configuration
If you like to use your configuration as a template for further models, it's a good idea, to save your configuration:
Click the + symbol in the customizer, which you find beside the configuration selector drop-down in the second line of the customizer.
Give your configuration a name.
Use the drop-down menu to access your saved configurations."

This is a portable rack for storing and transporting typical plastic part storage boxes available cheaply anywhere. The ones I used can be found here
The system is modular. Print one base, one lid, and as many trays as you need. Each piece connects to the one below it with 7 snap-in clips, so take that into account as you're printing them. Feet printed in TPU ensure your furniture won't get scratched. There are small articulated lips on the trays to discourage the storage boxes from sliding out while you're carrying it around.
The pins that hold the handle to the lid are problematic. You don't want too tight a fit, or the handle won't spin, and too loose and the pins won't stay in place. You may need to scale them up or down depending on your printer's tolerances. I printed them scaled down a bit and held them in place with a couple of dabs of super glue. They're really quick to print so you can experiment to dial in the fit.
Printing:
The trays need no supports if your printer is dialed-in. The two exceptions are the base which has inset cutouts for the feet, and the TPU feet which need a tiny bit of support for the hooks. The lid should print fine without supports if your printer is well-tuned.
If you need to print a lot of clips like I did (49 in total) do yourself a favor and use a raft. There isn't a lot of surface area when you stand it up on its side. It's a bit more work at the end to clean them up, but you won't have parts sliding off the bed several hours into a print.
For one build you will need to print:
1 Lid
1 Handle
2 Pins
1 Base
4 Feet (Foots?)
Var Trays desired
7 Clips per tray, lid, or base
Future versions:
I've already had requests for a lid with incorporated storage inside like some commercial parts racks on the market. That's probably what I'll work on next if there's enough interest.

I got tired of the normal hammer holders and not having direct access to a hammer (when you stack them) so I came up with this. I made it modular sp print as many as you have hammers for. I designed it to not require support. Print the triangle face down. I tried to make the screws where they would self tap. It works, but it will melt the PLA due to friction. So I ended up taking a tap and tapping the pegboard itself. I also tried putting some gun oil on the screw and then letting it self tap. That actually worked fairly well if you don't have access to a M8 x 1.25 tap. May try making the screws out of PETG or ABS. Of course you can always use a traditional screw, but you will likely have to cut it down. 5/16in bolt will work nicely. I just like how it looks with a flush mounted printed screw.
One of my biggest constraints I gave myself is only wanting to take up no more than 2 inches (pegboard holes) in the horizontal direction. So some larger hammers might not work as well. Just play with it and put the bigger mallets on the ends.
Print the screws at .15 layer and 100% infill

Major Features
Unique, Easy-To-Assemble Design
This helmet was designed to fit together like a 3D puzzle. Almost no glue is required to assemble this helmet, meaning that it can be taken apart and put back together repeadetly for limitless customization!
This model is comprised of 40+ pieces to ensure that the entire process requires the least supports and to ensure that the sanding/painting assembly process is as painless as possible.
Customizable Helmet Attachments
Both the UA and HUL helmet variations are included in this helmet and can be removed and added to the helmet at will.
Visor Insert Features
The inside of the helmet features Guides to hold the visor in place. While the visor can sit on these alone I would recommend a low strength glue or tape to help fasten hit while still allowing you to remove the visor.
Sizing Ring
Model includes a sizing ring to help you scale the helmet to fit over your head. Sizing ring is a equal to the size of the throat of the helmet so make it so you can fit your whole head through without slicing your ears off.
Full Visor Resin Kit
This model includes a full kit to help you make a mold capable of casting a resin visor. A resin visor in and of itself will have some reflective properties while more importantly allow you to make the visor see-through and a color of your choice. It also allows for more complex geometries than vacuum forming and makes for a sturdier visor. I went with a simpler mold shell design without an alignment baseplate for this design. The visor and mold shell sheathe together, so just ensure that the visor plug is not touching any of the walls before pouring in the molding agent. As usual, I recommend glueing the two pieces to a flat piece of cardboard. The mold shell is designed to be able to flip over and stand flat when pouring in Resin to ensure the top does not leak or pour resin.
Visor Resin Volume: 192 mL
Visor Rubber Mold Volume: 621 mL"

The QT Py RP2040 is perfect for projects that need a display and a few key switches. The enclosure is 3D printed with parts that snap fit together.

Design Considerations
The anti-topple support at the rear of the design is caculated on the assumption that the hard drives' center of gravity is at the center point of the hard drive. If the center of gravity is off-center, it may be necessary to increase the Additional_Topple_Support_Percent value to compensate. Use the tools under the 'Preview' tab to help you.
Material
This design is perfect for printing in many filaments, including PLA, PETG and ABS.

There are a lot of very fine systems around to build a dungeon with but I found they tended to be too time consuming to build for those ""quick encounters"" that one didn't prepare in advance.

This is just a little project I did for myself to make my job as a dungeon master a little easier but I thought I'd share it just in case other dm's had the same problem.

This process took well over a week of late nights on Photoshop and MatterHacker. I have seen thousands of different versions of this clock all over Etsy (all cut from Vinyl Records) so I wasn't able to track down the true original artist, if you know who that is, please leave a comment so they can be rightfully attributed.
Clock Movement Used: Mudder Silence Quartz Clock Movement, 11/25 Inch Maximum Dial Thickness, 4/5 Inch Total Shaft Length (White)
I intentionally made the center hole for the clock shaft 0.5mm smaller so it has a snug fit, you can easily widen this with an Xacto Knife or even just a kitchen knife to suite your clock movements needs.
This was designed to be printed on a Prusa MK3S+, I sized this to be exactly as large as the print bed would allow for. Be careful when scaling for other printers as the center hole may become too small.
I recommend you print slowly, especially on the first layer and make sure your Z-Height is spot on, otherwise the finer details will get blurred.
You will need something to affix to the back of the clock movement to mount it to the wall (if you use the one above- others have built in hangers). I personally used some super glue and attached Geotk's Handy Picture Hanger.
Also included in the files are 2 GCODE files for a Prusa MK3S+ with PLA filament- one with ironing and one without. I like the non-ironed version, as it looks a bit more like the surface of the vinyl record my original one was cut from."

Spade - Infil to add weight, no supports
Letters - Print flat, already scaled to fit nicely in the embossing
Star - Infil to add weight.
Full print with 4x4x4 walls/top/bottom and 38% infil came to about 48g in weight.
Glue in lettering and spade. Star may need minor sanding but should push fit into the space tightly and not need anything else to secure it."

Yes it uses a lot of filament but that was by choice. I love the feel of well made products with some weight to it.
In the files listed I've added two ""TEST"" parts so you can make sure you can fit the letter ""N"" into the ""TEST"" file and the ""Nintendo_White"" file into the ""Red_TEST"" file.
If you run into any clearance issues try to re level your bed and if that still doesn't work upload the file to any 3D modelling editor and add 0.50mm to the hole size on ""Nintendo_White"" file or the ""Nintendo_Red"" file.
All letters were glued into place. with the letter "" i "" I used a ruler or straight edge to align it with the letter ""N"" to make sure it was straight. I forgot to add 2 pegs to each section of the "" i "" so you wouldn't need to do that sorry. :S
For the smooth finish on the letters and red boarder I printed the parts upside down on my smooth flex plate bed for a better overall look. Just keep in mind if you're going to print them upside down to add supports!

Mounted on a vertical surface, this can be used to hold hats, bags, etc.
The cone is a replica of a Joy Cone #40. The cone model file is set to 90% of the actual diameter of the Joy Cone #40. Therefore, if you want the cone to be actual size, scale up the models so that the cone prints at 66.67mm diameter.
I remixed the melting ice cream from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2771969 provided by @Doodleform. I liked the general shape of the original model, but I wanted something that was more organic in how the melted ice cream flowed and adhered to the surface.
I printed the cone in Wood PLA (Hatchbox) @ 0.2mm layers.
I printed the ice cream in PETG Bright White V2 (Atomic) @ 0.1 layers, 3 shells, 4 solid layers top/bottom, and a 60% infill. The high infill and the high number of top/bottom layers help to provide a smooth top surface of the melted ice cream.
I sanded the cone with 400 grit paper. This also helps to make the cone look more realistic by lightening the outermost waffle grid on the cone base,
I sanded the ice cream with 800 grit paper. The goal is to reduce the layer lines at the top of the melted puddles. I used my finger nail to remove tiny PETG blobs.
I sprayed the ice cream with about four coats of glossy clear coat enamel.
I glued the cone to the ice cream with gel-type (Loctite) superglue.
I attached the ice cream to a wall with 3M command strips."

Die Basis wurde für kleinere Drucker deren Druckbett 200 x 200 beträgt
in 3 Teile gesplittet.
Es ist nun möglich diese mit kleineren Druckern zu erstellen.
Die Trennungen sind in den Bildern Rot gekennzeichnet.
Zum Anpassen der Teile sollte dort „Gefeilt“ werden.
Die anderen Teile Überlappen diese Stellen mit der Vernietung.

Nonetheless that implementation is based on SCAD which results in mesh files. If you prefer to model project parts directly in Fusion 360, this thing is for you!
Regardless of the theoretical foundation of this design it should work fine for all your gt2 pulley needs.
You can change the design via Fusion's User Parameters feature. But be careful when increasing the grooves count. For some reason Fusion struggles with large changes like 20 to 80 but works fine with 20 to 50 to 80.
It took me quite some time to get my head around the math behind the grooves. Contrary to popular belief the profile is not just an inverse of the belts teeth. For a belt wrapped all around a pulley it would be that way, but given that a belt leaves the pulley at some point there appears an issue. The reason being, that the belt and pulley move exactly the same distance, the belt in a straight line - to or away from the wheel - and the pulley in a circular path around it's center. The grooves profile has to account for the change in distance and orientation to the belt. The mathematical concept to describe this relative change is called 'involute'. Have a look at the attached Fusion 360 file to get an idea how it works.
If you have doubts about this tooth profile I would love to discuss them in the comments. (e.g. contact surface vs. clearance)"

Apologies in advance if there is already something similar on Thingiverse that I have not noticed.
This thing IMHO improves the part cooling of the Hot End by providing focused symmetrical cooling to either side of the nozzle rather than the stock design pushing air to the rear of the nozzle and in some instances cooling the heater block rather than the part.
The Mk1 design cools quite well but a lot of the focus is not centred to just below the nozzle. After 30 plus test designs and CFD simulations this version provides much better focus to the target without too much air restriction. I am currenting printing 3D Benchies @ only 60% fan speed with sufficient part cooling.
The design includes a removable Blade Duct assembly to allow for ease of changing and maintaining nozzles. The assembly is based on a M3 thermal insert and a M3 x 8mm hex bolt. To achieve this design I also had to modify the Pinda Mount Bracket to clear the left hand duct.
THIS VERSON IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE V1 AND ALL PARTS REQUIRE
REPRINTING.
In the Duct Base Mount I have replaced the rear square nut cavity for the Pinda Mount with a M3 thermal insert in the Base mount because the slot made the part weak and was continually splitting.
In my tests\porotypes the parts fit very snuggly and there is no air bleed. If this is not the case after printing with these parts a small amount of Vaseline or similar on the connecting faces will probably cure this.
I have only tried this with my V6 based variation but cannot really see why this should not work for the stock setup. So untested with the stock heat sink and nozzle arrangement.
The parts do not need support if printed in the uploaded orientation except for the Blade duct which requires some custom supports to the duct apertures around the central fin.. There are some some surfaces that push the boundaries of draft angles but these are inherent of the original prusa design parts and not of choosing or design.
The test print so far IMHO are much improved and both my water nozzle tests and the 32 Sim Scale CFD simulations I have undertaken have the air flow right in the ball park just below the centre of the nozzle which is usually a good indictor to suggest good part cooling rather than cooling the nozzle or heater block.
The following test is to visually confirm the air flow of the part cooling fan duct design is directly below the nozzle in support of the theoretical Simscale CFD tests undertaken during the process of this design.

This time the two LED strips are directly glued onto each other, facing in opposite directions, creating a great glowing halo effect.
Both strips are placed inside a huge channel within the ring sections. Since the LED strips are completely covered by plastic. The electronics are completely covered and the only hint is the power strip. This is probably the easiest to build version of the series to far. Printing is easy, assembly is even more easy than with prior versions and the transparent ring transmits the light around the entire ring and not only to the inside or outside. This makes the new version the most kids friendly edition. It also makes it easier to dust the lamp, as there are no electronics exposed.
You need a printer with around 220x220mm build plate to be able to print the big version.
Key Features:
When designing this I had some key features in mind:
° simple and clean print
° avoid the led strips glue tape on the back at all cost.
° add a simple compartment for the electronics.
° wire management
° easy to print.
° no flimsy pegs to mount, which fail printing or break away later on.
Requirements:
1x 5V power supply
1x Power Connector
1x Switch (optional)
1x LED strip. (60 pixel/m or more)
WARNING! You need a LED strip without a rubber dome. Just the plain flexible PCB with the LEDs and resistors soldered on.
I used a 60 pixel/mm LED strip and ended up using 120 LEDs (60/60) in total for the big version and 70 LEDs (35/35) for the smaller version.
Printing:
You need to print a the socket, the lid and four ring pieces. One of the ring segments has an opening for the wiring. The other file marked with 3x need to be printed three times.
Make sure you pick the matching files for the radius. The socket for the 100mm (R100) ring will not fit the 165mm (R165) radius sized ring and vice versa.
It is important to print the ring with 100% infill and 0% supports. Support will be visible later when the ring is lit. Feel free to experiment with infill. I personally like the unified full plastic glow.
As mentioned you must not use support for the ring segments. This is because the LED strip guide would be filled with support, which in the end cannot be removed. So: Do not use support for the ring segments. It is not required.
Another important thing: Use a raft when printing the ring segments. Yes, rafts take a while to print and eat a lot of plastic as well, but so do the ring segments and one single fail or a warped and thereby unusable ring segment wastes even more plastic. Especially when having issues with temperatures in the print bed corners, a raft saves filament and not the opposite. So adding one hour per ring segment isn't that bad compared to a total fail after 3 hours of printing. Better get it done right the first time, instead of failing several times first. Bonus effect: The ring will look more or less the same on both sides, which is great.
Preparation:
Before starting the assembly, you need to ensure the LED strip opening is free and easy to use. Pull a wire through each ring section and make it rattle on the inside to ensure there aren't any printed blobs or walls from stringing blocking the channel.
The bottom left ring segment (the 1x one) has a little compartment on one side, which has one very thin outer wall. You need to break away that wall, as that's where the wires sneak into the socket.
Now it is a good idea to test the LED strip if possible. There is a test mode build into firmware that you can enable to activate additional testing options. In main.h you find ""ENABLE_TESTMODE"" turn it on. Since your strip is usually not cut at this state you need to change the number of LEDs per strip to the total number you want to test. So changing the first LED strips LED count to 300 in ""configuration.h"" should do the job. Just remember to change it back later or the effects will be broken as they assume a longer strip.
For testing log into the web interface and turn the test mode inside global section on. A test mode selection will be now visible in misc section. Changing it will effect the strip immediately. You should be able to select red, blue, green and white and confirm that every LED is responding correctly. If not you have to cut the broken LED and resolder the joint.
Assembly:
Lay out the ring sections in print orientation. The sides will look a little different due to the print process. E.g. place the side print bed side down. Make sure the segment with the opening is facing towards you.
Remove the sticky tape from both LED strips and push them against each other. Make sure you get them as good on top of each other than possible. I added some pictures to show how it should look like. Also make sure the arrows (data direction) on the strips are facing in opposite directions.
You can solder wires to the end of the LED strips right now. It is important you solder the data lines to the side where the arrow point into the strip. For 5V and GND this is not important. This soldering step can be done later, too. Since the strips are in opposite directions you can use a little wire to connect 5V of both strips together at the end and use just one power wire to power them. Same should be possible with the GND connector. The result looks a little blobby and ugly (see pictures), but it gets the job done easy and this way you only need two wires for gnd/power and two for the data lines.
Now feed the entire LED strip through the opening of all ring segments starting at the bottom, where the little opening is. As result you should have a loosely connected ring on the table.
If not done earlier this is your last chance to solder the wires to the strips ends. Make sure they are long enough. To be on the save side, just use long wires and cut them later. You only need around 100mm to 150mm. Feed the wires though the opening to the outside.
Using a little bit of glue the segments are quick attached together. When you printed the ring segments using ABS you can use acetone as glue to weld the sections together, which makes assembly much easier and the result is as strong as if you would have printed the ring in one piece. Why? -> Because of chemical welding.
Take your time and let the glued sections harden before moving over to the next section. If you rush it just gets messy very fast. Repeat the gluing step. It is the best to glue the bottom right section to the 3/4 ring last. Make sure the wires are in position, put glue on both ends and press the rings together. Optional you can leave the bottom section without glue. In that case you need to ensure the gab is closed while gluing the socket onto the ring.
When the ring is done and fully cured you can do another test run to see if the LED strip survived, but it is not required. If there is no visible damage, then you did not break it.
Feed the wires into the socket and glue it on. Align it as you like. It is not required to 100% have the ring opening above the socket opening.
Slide in the switch (if you printed the version with the opening for it) into the socket and glue the power connector in place. The power switch connectors pins need to be flattened, to make it fit into the socket. You can solder both components after mounting them, but I found it easier to add the wires and some heat shrink tubing before that.
You are now nearly done. Connect the ESP32 and done. This is just basic stuff. Connect all 5V to 5V, all GND to GND and the inner ring light data line to pin G23 of the ESP. The outer rings LED strip data line needs to be connected to pin G22.
You can use any kind of software to drive the ring lamps LED strip. Even use an Arduino and some example code.
There is an archive containing the source code included. Please check the read me file for further details.
I made a video to show the build process more or less in detail.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Ccoee1Y5A
Language is German, so be warned. :D The video is also for the revision 1 of the ring, but beside minor changes the assembly is mainly the same.
Current Features:
° web interface
° OTA update support
° flash fs settings support
° LED color and temperature correction
° 12 effects (static, rainbow, fire place, RGB fader, ...)
° optional sound support (hour/30 min gong) (requires DFPlayer sound module)
° timed power mode: The ring lamp turns on and off at a specific hours.
° timed dimming mode: The ring lamp changes brightness at specific hours.
° timed sound mode: The ring lamp changes volume at specific times.
° Full fledged Alexa support.
° Optional button support for quick on/off/audio switch.
Customize:
To customize the ring you need at least FreeCAD 0.19.1 or up. The model is fully parametric and you should be able to modify stuff like the size of the opening for the switch by just tweaking the spreadsheet. Of course this also works for all other dimensions.
Parts:
I changed the default design to use a standard toggle switch which can be found on coffee makers.
For the power inlet I used a power jack adapter. You find them on internet routers, USB hubs, scanners and other low power devices.
I usually salvage these parts before throwing old hardware away, so I have a bunch of them. The power connector is not optimal, but looks nice, when glued into the base. As said the model is customizable, so you can use what ever you have at hand.
If you want to use something different, just change the width and height values inside the spreadsheet.
Finally the LED strip. I used this one: BTF Lighting WS2812B
Any WS2812B strip should do. Just make sure there is no rubber dome above it. Those water resistant versions are not working.
Final Words:
If there are any questions feel free to write a comment. Please post a make, so people can see my model really works and I get positive feedback in the same process, too.

It's not going to be as robust as Chris or Teaching Tech's design simply because plastic is not going to be as strong as metal. So why do it? Because I don't have those parts and I'm lazy to source for them. Just kidding ok. I just want to challenge myself to what extend 3D printing can achieve and also to brush up on my CAD skills. I'm not an engineer so I made an unnecessarily complicated design but it is fun and I definitely learned new things along the process.
I use Fusion 360 to design the model. While trying to maintain a supportless design I tried many different options but I still end up with the dovetail design. I do not want to use any external fasteners so this limits the design options further. In order to print the dovetail without support, I split them into 2 parts. The lead screws are another weak point so I made them to be printed horizontally on the bed instead of vertically.
I also took the idea of the folding handle from Teaching Tech's design.
The smallest clamps are a pain to work with. You may need to scale them bigger by 3-4% if you find them too tight to fit, although all the clamps have 0.3mm clearance between them. Do a test print for fit testing. I do not have an idea how to fully retain the smallest clamp in place so feel free to suggest or remix them. The step files are included.
Printing the parts:
-All parts should be printed as per uploaded orientation without any supports.
-Refer to the name of the STL for how many units to print for each part.
-All parts were printed with 20% infill except for the Mainbed at only 10%. Not necessarily need to follow this.
-The Clamp holder A/B was printed with adaptive layer heights in prusaslicer for a smoother surface on the curve part. (higher resolution on the curve area, lower resolution on the not so curve area)
-Watch out for elephant foot when printing the lead screws
-The C-clamp is included but I do not suggest using them unless you are able to print it in very strong material.
-Some glues are recommended for the handle and large clamp clip if they are too loose.

546,https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4900678,31,,Eagle 1 (Fixed!) Easy-Print -- Space 1999,"by PrintMaker28 July 04, 2021","This is a massive re-work of the 12"" (31cm) long ""easy-print/build"" Eagle 1 by korb3n and later, alpokemon. The original model had huge issues with the proportions of the center body/pod section, engines and cockpit, when compared with the on-screen studio model.
It's now about as screen-accurate as practical, but a significant amount more work could be done on fine-tuning surface details (greebles) and still-outstanding corrections. The octagonal landing ""leg"" surface greeble details are all wrong and a lot of people may not realize that they are not detail-symmetrical at all, front to back or side to side!
For those that are curious, I've added a proportional comparison of this model and David Sisson's original 44"" studio model (red bars are the same width). The lens and distance used to shoot the photos will distort some aspects, but a few things are now obvious! The engine bells are too large in diameter (now fixed!) and the front/rear body blocks areas might not be quite the right length (hard to tell, the model does match the reference drawing pretty closely...).
I tried to improve upon alpokemon's efforts at making it simple to print/build. I did away with the ""alignment cubes"" and simply made it that the core of the model can be assembled on a flat surface, using superglue (cyanoacrylate).
The included ""exploded-view"" of the model is NOT all the parts, it's just showing the positional relationship of the major components.

Major corrections/modifications:
The center ""pod"" was significantly narrowed, the windows were moved to the correct position, the cutout above the door was repaired, surface greebles were fixed/added and the underside VTOL engine and the pod landing gear points were correctly positioned. The lowest part of the outer pod detail is still incorrect, but that's on the to-do list!
The front/rear halved body sections were narrowed and had small underside tabs added to make building on a flat surface possible (just line-up the marks and follow the text!) All the existing ""tabs"" that located the grids were removed and a slot-system was implemented to line them up and make the grid positions more screen-accurate. The ""leg"" pins were moved to position the legs correctly. Simple surface greebles were added to the tops. VTOL engines underneath were moved to the correct position.
The engines were cleaned-up and significantly shortened The engine bells had some minor detailing added, but need to be re-sized slightly.
The octagonal ""legs"" were slightly re-proportioned, meaning that some circular greebles are now a bit oval!
The main landing gear was shortened to the ""compressed"" landed state, not the extended ""flying"" state they were originally in. alpokemon's original versions are readily available, if desired.
All grids were narrowed, meaning the front side grids have slightly oval tubes! Some new tubes replaced old ones, but the cross-hatch detail is still the old narrowed detail. Rear grids completely rebuilt from scratch, tube size is a bit ""thick"", but it helps in printing!

Printing/Build Notes:
All parts were printed on a factory-stock Ender 3 Max, using Cura 4.10.0* (see below) and cheap Creality ""Ender"" PLA filament.
The only part that required support was the cockpit (which is printed vertically, like the main pod), that said, a 75-degree limit was used to minimize the support material to where it was relevant. (FYI, the Ender 3 Max's dual-fan print-head is very good at bridging gaps and printing angled surfaces without support)
All parts, except the cockpit and pod, used a 15% infill. To save filament, an 8% infill was used on the cockpit and pod. The grids did not suffer from not using a 100% infill, I suspect they are too small in cross-section for infill to be used in any case.
A lot of parts, like the grids, have very limited surface area where they contact the printing bed, so brims (see photo) are a good idea to avoid having the parts detach from the bed! That said, the grids, engines and engine bells can be successfully printed without brims, but it's risky (50/50 chance of a failure). The larger parts can generally be printed without brims since it eliminates time-consuming post-printing clean-up.
Since the main parts are simply butt-glued together, a wide flat file is your friend! You want the mating surfaces to be smooth and flat.
Use very little glue on the mating surfaces. Press & hold the joint for a few seconds, then if needed, put drops along the joint-lines and it will wick into the void almost instantly.
Cura 4.10.0 (Windows) is still very ""twitchy"" when it comes to hanging while slicing. More often than not, it will hang forever and not complete a slice operation. I have found that randomly moving/rotating the part on the Cura ""virtual"" bed and re-slicing will eventually make the slicing work! Sometimes it takes many tries, YMMV..."

Assembly
- Use 2x M2.5x18 screws to connect lid to body.
- Designed to be printed from PLA, but if you have problem with lid clip durability, use PETG.
- If screws are loose and can't cut thread into the lid, use Lid_v2. It has smaller hole for the screw.
Notes
- It works for me with PLA except silk ones.
- If possible, use M2.5x16 or M2,5x18 screws.

It uses only about 1 meter of material.
It is small and will break easily if overworked, so it is of no use to you, but it works like a machine.
After printing is finished, gently twist the lever or rod part or use a cutter to remove the adhesion.
If the adhesions are properly removed, you can push and pull the ring to open and close the gripping part slightly.
The loop spring part can be easily broken if strong force is applied. On the other hand, if you apply only weak force, the spring will remain stiff for a long time. If you bend it moderately and deform it plastically, it will continue to work well for a while.
There are two types of data. The one with the file name ""manipulator"" closes the gripping part when the ring is pushed in, and the one with the file name ""reverse operation"" closes the gripping part when the ring is pulled.
I made this as a challenge to design the mechanism that is established by bending the material as small as possible, so I didn't attach much importance to how well it could be used. It's good for people like me who find it interesting to see how this works, or for people who want to show it to children and give them hints on how to make something, but if you really want to use it for something, click here.

I've previously remixed this case for the RPI3B and decided that I wanted to make it for my RPI4B, too - and while remodelling it to fit the 4B, I also fixed a lot of mistakes that I made on the 3B version. Some of the changes include:
thinner walls: The case requires roughly 50% less material and print time now. The walls on the original were waaaaay too thick
more vent holes: I put some more holes under the PCB and on the back of the case for better ventilation. Also, the holes on the sides now better match the original model
added the little ""feet"" on the front
added the little curves on the sides
added the asymmetric frame on the back
moved the insert and power button up to better match the original Gamecube's appearance (they seemed a bit too low to me on the original model...?)
made a new connection for the handle that properly snaps in place now
made the front piece more rounded to better match the original Gamecube's
added the logo to the top insert because I thought the blank one looks a bit bland. Btw: the logo's a tight fit - you may have to carefully hammer it into the insert's indent

The standoffs are standard 25 mm of the wall. You screw the standoffs with one screw on the place you like and when the hexagon is put in place you won't see a screw anymore.
Since there is space between the wall and the hexagon, the plant can curl behind the hexagon which makes a nice guide for the plant.
Tips:
Clips - For a tight, but really tight, fit you have to print the clips at 100% scale, for a bit more lose fit, but easier set up you would like to print the clips on 95% scale."

I had it printed at i.materialise with the Polyamide MJF material with black dye. The mount was designed with that process in mind and may not work with with FDM printing.
It requires drilling 3 holes in the top case-half. The mount is secured to the top case-half because there isn't much room with the MODE installed. I countersunk tapered head screws.
The mounting holes are off by a few thou, but they are oversized so they still fit. Make sure to use a washer that is larger than the mounting holes (~7/32"").

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4859864 Holster Source by atonac
The blaster in the pictures is from Kaminoan Customs and is not included, I saw it pop up on Instagram and grabbed it.
My first project really. Remixed the posed Commando by sanek94cool and modified it in Blender with very limited knowledge so it can be used on figures. I did create some unique parts for Scorch, Fixer, and Sev. Scorch has his thigh equipment and backpack. Fixer has his backpack, however I was unable to create his shoulder pad and helmet with my current skill set. Finally Sev has his unique shoulder and leg piece.
I should note Sev's gear may not look as expected because I designed them based off the 501st database and some other images I found. I assumed his equipment is holding extra sniper rounds.
If you would like to get the alternative weapons or equipment, you will have to source them elsewhere for now.
I used the new Black Series clone body for my test but a significant amount of material had to be removed. For the helmet you need to cover the neck joint in Vaseline and fill the helmet with hotglue and hold it. It's a pretty neat way of making joints for things that don't quite fit.
As for other options, you can probably use some SH Figuarts Clone base figure for better results. If you have any skills and a FDM Printer or Flex Resin you could probably print your own body and modify the parts.
Printed on a Elegoo Mars 2 Pro with standard resin, I strongly recommend something with a bit of flex so it will go together easier.
If you would like to make a remix of my remix, please do so and improve on what I did. If you would also like my Blend files I will happily send you my mess so you can look at it, they are too big to upload here."

It isn't much work and requires you to only identify the GND and trigger wire from your auto bed leveling sensor. You should use a multimeter to confirm the process by which your printer ""sees"" the signal from your sensor. In most cases the trigger / signal pin normally sits at 3.3V or 5V and is pulled to GND when the sensor is tripped. You can then use a mechanical end stop switch to do the same by wiring the signal pin and a GND wire to the NO (normally open) pins on the end stop. When the mechanical end stop is triggered, the signal pin will then be connected to GND and perform the same function as the auto bed level sensor.
I used the Creality Y-Axis switch that can be found here in this video:
► https://www.digitmakers.ca/products/cr-10-endstop-limit-switch?variant=10907822555172
I designed an adjustable bumper for the end stop switch that mounts to the vertical profile. You can find those parts here:
► YOU ARE HERE
You will need a few M3 screws (10mm and 20mm length) and some M3 T-slot nuts to assemble and mount the adjustable bumper.
This process and system should work on a variety of printer types such as Creality, ANET, Tevo, Alfawise, Geeetech, Raiscube, Sainsmart, etc.

Improved feet to base connection as it was a major point of failure. Thicken the base to improve success rate. Printed in silk pla at .4 nozzle. Ignore the tips if you print in normal pla & you dont upscale. If printing normal size with pla, use your own settings
TIPS (for silk PLA && upscaled to 175%):
-First layer should be printed with the most plastic possible (200% at 50 speed).
-I had to set the bottom solid layers at 25 (or the feet will not stick to the base and fail). I tried 3 bttom solid layers, to save material, but it failed.
-Where the hotend starts for each layer, IS VERY IMPORTANT. I believe my setting was (110x, 90y). Change from (find the fast point for fastest print) => (begin each layer closes to these coordinates). Try to have the hotend start each layer in the middle of the back of the figure. Once the print reaches the lower elbow, this will be the highest point of failure.
-Upscale by 75% to be real life size (100% => 175%)
-Print the shell at 5 layers. It will reduce rate of failure (I tried 3 layers with many failures)
-Infill can be between 10-20%
-Took about 8 hours.
-If there is blobbing, try printing from inside out or vise versa.
I went thru about 25 failed prints. This print will require you to use excess material or you risk failure.

Oh boy was it harder than I expected. It's not perfect, but it's one of my first bigger designs I've made so far and it looks pretty nice, but it does need supports.
Fusion 360 was crashing with the amount of extrusions probably because I don't know what I'm doing lol. My print turned out ok, but ABS might not be the best choice for this piece because it needs cooling towards the end, I seemed to have small issues at the last layer of hex's where they fell apart a bit.
I suggest printing the last few layers slowly."

The idea is to block the annoying red light coming from the BL touch, as there is no way of turning it off. The part is a friction fit. There are 2x versions, one with an arrow and one without, use whichever you prefer :)
Printing in black blocks out all the light, but lighter colours may let the light through which could look cool.
I recommend 0.1mm layer height so the arrow comes out nicely. I also recommend printing with a brim as the bottom does not have much surface area."

They may be refitted for hyperspace transmission. --- [END TRANSMISSION]
This is a snap-together model designed to be 3D printed as terrain for 6mm tabletop gaming. It's perfect for an open field, spaceport, or any tabletop map you want to play. It can be used as a receiving radio telescope to survey space or track spaceships, or you can use it in your games as some sort of ""hyperspace pulse generator."" When pointing straight up, the rim of the dish is 4 levels tall if you're playing a specific mecha tabletop game.
There are four files. One of each of the base both with and without hexes so that you can print the one that fits your playstyle. One shoulder piece that slots into the base. And one dish half. In the future I may update this page with a couple additional dish designs.
Instructions:
-See below for more print settings.
-Print a base, shoulder, and two dish halves. Everything prints supportless as oriented. The base and shoulder print perfectly, and the only tricky part is the dish halves. Test prints by multiple people indicate that depending on your settings, the angled overhangs on the antenna struts sometimes fail, but it seems to be nearly random whether they do or don't. I have thickened them to reduce the odds of failure. If you have a resin printer and resin with a little flex, then you may wish to print the dish in resin - it will also give you a super smooth finish.
-Print the base and dish without any brim. In particular, adding brims to the dish will make cleanup a pain.
-Print the shoulder with a brim. The pictured models were test printed with an 8-line brim to keep them adhered and steady.
-After printing all the pieces, apply super-glue to one half of the dish before carefully pressing the second half to it. After a few seconds, I recommend pushing the clip onto the shoulder piece which will hold the bottom of the dish together. Then you can take a moment to ensure the dish is aligned before pressing and holding the antenna tip together while the glue dries.
As always, tipping is appreciated at: paypal.me/rainingfire416
Notable features:
-Rotating dish and separately rotating shoulder pieces allow the dish to point in any direction in the sky.
-Detailed design including entrance door and supported walkway.
The model units are in mm and it is scaled such that the hexes are 33mm from flat-to-flat, which is perfect for modern hex maps using 33mm hexes. You can always resize it if your hexes are slightly smaller/larger.
Please post pictures and leave feedback if you make this yourself! I'd love to see prints and use the feedback to adjust overhangs, detail levels, etc. on this model and future ones as well."

696,https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4895614,23,,Rainbow Box,"by mowens995 June 27, 2021","This is an 85 step sequential discovery puzzle box with two internal compartments. I plan to put together assembly instructions in the near future, but in the meantime I posted a disassembly video on reddit (username: mowens995) that can be used for tips.
All pieces are designed to be printable without supports, but depending on the calibration of your printer I would recommend using supports with the floor, subfloor and red .stl files.
As for layer height - standard 0.3mm should be sufficient for most pieces, but I would recommend using a lower height (0.2mm works for me) on the Tools file.
Tolerances and clearances are very tight on this design to allow it to function correctly. If your printer is decently calibrated, and don't use any specialty filaments (wood PLA specifically gave me a lot of trouble) a few passes along each piece's full range of motion should scrape off any rough edges and allow them to move smoothly. However, if you still have troubles, I've found that metal files or sandpaper help dramatically.
This is also printable at 80% scale - which is my personal favorite size, however due to the scaled down clearances between pieces this version requires a decent amount of post processing to become completely functional.
Update 6/29: If you've already printed Misc.stl, I realized one piece was incorrectly oriented. I have updated the file now and included a file of the individual piece called Rotated_Misc_Piece.stl. I also updated Purple.stl to help it fit better.
Update 6/30: If you've already printed Floor.stl, I've uploaded a revised file that should fit easier with Subfloor.st.
Update 7/1: I updated the largest piece of the Clouds.stl file to be able to move more smoothly without post-processing."

This model was designed with FDM printing in mind but you might have better results with an SLA printer. If printed on an FDM printer, you will need a 0.25mm nozzle (or finer) and layer heights of 0.05mm.
all of the parts should fit together easily and only need a small amount of glue, The model uses two alignment blocks to make sure it remains square.
You will have to print every part once except for the lights (in 3 parts) and the buffers that have to be printed 4 times as well as the breaks that need to be printed twice."

The main body slides in and out of the case attached to the belt.
Please ignore the splatters of paint on the prototype, it’s from another project.
I printed this in PLA+, but I can't see why any material wouldn't work just as well.
There are 4 wall's and 10% infill and I printed at a 2mm layer height.
I printed the case upright and the insert horizontal.
I used supports but that’s down to your discretion.
There are two versions of the outer case.
One with a Molle attachment that's designed for standard belts like the one pictured. (Note, I made this to fit through all three loops on this style of belt)
One has a belt loop for a normal belt, you may need to alter to fit your belt.
There are two versions of the inner slide.
One is just an open space 20mm deep / 20mm wide / 130mm height
The other has a divide, because why not.
The pictured pouches are my prototypes so please ignore the issues you'll see. I’ve made some slight adjustments since the printed version.
I did need to sand the slide sections to get a bit better a fit.
As always have fun. A round version will be coming.

Both where at the battle of the Yalu river, and proved to be impervious to most Japanese guns of the time. Unfortunately for the Chinese, Dingyuan, which was the Beiyang fleet flagship, fired her main guns forward, which destroyed the command deck, resulting in all the Chinese officers to be Killed or wounded. The rest of the fleet, without any direction, performed poorly until the end of the battle.
The two battleship then took part in the battle of Weihaiwei, where Zhengyuan was captured by the Japanese and Dingyuan destroyed.
Renamed Chin Yen by the Japanese, Zhengyuan participated in the Russo japanese war, notably during the famous Tsushima battle where she engaged the battleship Kniaz Sovorov. she was retired from service in 1911 and scrapped. Her anchors where returned to China after WW2 in 1947.

Unfortunately the center of gravity is too far away from the wall for just the mount alone to keep it from falling over but I used a very small velcro command strip at the nose which works great. It feels extremely secure and I have had it mounted for weeks now with no issue.
The mount was designed with #8 countersunk screws in mind. Only the top one is really needed.

DESCRIPTION:
This is a modell of the A4B truckspeeder from the solo movie.
""Moloch uses this hulking Trast Heavy Transports A-A4B truckspeeder for White Worm missions in Coronet City or elsewhere on Corellia. His truckspeeder is formidably armored, with a noisy, powerful engine. A forward cage holds a pack of Corellian hounds trained at sniffing out fugitives"" [info from starwars.com]
Designed in 1:100 (HO) scale
I tried to be as screen accurate as possible, minor changes are made to make printing easier and I added a back door and compartment. (its a TRUCK after all, so you should be able to transport things.;-) )
Many Hours of design went into the modelling of this Thing, so if you download and print it a tip (5$ or so) would be highly appriciated. Please Keep in mind that a original Star Wars Toy would be much more expensive. ;-)
Printing recommendations:
Print the main parts upright standing on the parting side, the door, seat anf cowcatcher lying flat on the side you see on the part-pictures. And as some Details are very small I recommend using high-quality print mode. No supports needed. Wall thickness: 1mm and infill 10%."

About the Original Sculpture:
Ardhanarishvara
Tiruvenkadu, Thanjavur District. Height 101 cm. Around 11th Century AD.
The name Ardhanarishvara means ""the Lord Who is half woman."" Siva is represented here as half-male and half-female, typifying the male and female energies. The right half represents Siva and the left Parvati. Siva has a jatamakuta with a crescent moon. He has three arms of which the lower arm rests on the back of the bull, his vehicle., and the upper right has an axe. The whole of the right side is adorned with ornaments peculiar to Shiva. The right leg is bent and rests on the pedestal. The drapery is shown upto the knee. On the left side the image has a karandamakuta. The drapery is upto the anklets and her leg is slightly bent, resting on the pedestal.
The male half wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, adorned with a crescent moon. Sometimes the jata-mukuta is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a nakra-kundala, sarpa-kundala (""serpent-earring"") or ordinary kundala (""earring""). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (trinetra) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in the middle of the forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati's round dot. A common elliptical halo (prabhamandala/prabhavali) may be depicted behind the head; sometimes the shape of the halo may differ on either side.
The female half has karanda-mukuta (a basket-shaped crown) on her head or well-combed knotted hair or both. The left ear wears a valika-kundala (a type of earring). A tilaka or bindu (a round red dot) adorns her forehead, matching Shiva's third eye. The left eye is painted with black eyeliner. While the male neck is sometimes adorned with a jewelled hooded serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it. Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and a narrow feminine waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male part of the icon.The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves.
Ardhanarishvara is one of the most popular iconographic forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines dedicated to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. The concept of Ardhanarishvara originated in Kushan and Greek cultures simultaneously; the iconography evolved in the Kushan era (30–375 CE), but was perfected in the Gupta era (320-600 CE).

This is Soviet experimental offroad vehicle model has a 1/20 scale and based on WPL components. I made axles on leaf springs instead independent suspension because it was easy way. There are 2 speed gearbox, two DIY transfer gearboxes and a lot driveshafts.
3D model was converted from Spintires mod and edited in Sketchup.
Partlist:
WPL 2 speed gearbox
Middle axle
Steering axle 2 pcs
Driveshafts
Driveshafts+short
MG90S Metal servo 2pcs
Leaf springs
623 bearings
Radiocontrol as you wish
Front and rear axles has a steer and damped by leafs. Short driveshaft connect main gearbox with rear tranferbox. Between tranferboxes I puted DIY extended driveshaft. You can use universal joints (like this ) with a long steel rod between. Transerboxes has 2:1 reduction and connected to axles through driveshafts. A middle axle transfered power from both transferboxes for less stress. These driveshafts must be shortened as example photo because its not fitted.
Transferboxes assembled with plastic gears, custom shafts and a lot 623 bearings. Shafts made on the lathe and flatenned by file.
Notice: rear transferbox has 2 small gears and 1 big, front - 1 small, 1 big. Also need to check shafts rotate directions before installing axles.
Optional, I add 3d printed winch but made it smaller to fit into chassis."

The one in the photo is 8cm tall, printed with 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2 resolution by Ender 3 v2 in about 8 hrs. I didn't want to take a risk so went with 15% infill.

https://github.com/ahaque12/dog-poop-dispenser
Overview
Easy to print
Customizable to your liking (height, diameter, engraving)
Strong and functional design
After trying a few dispensers out on the market, I decided to
try designing my own. A few of the challenges I faced with dispensers
I've owned:
Cap falls off the container.
Ring can be small for certain leash clips.
Ring snaps off container.
Difficult to grab the first bag through the opening.
No way to know how much of the roll is left without opening the container.
Oversized container, making the roll shake when moving.
The design is an attempt to address all of these challenges. It also provides the
opportunity to engrave the container with your pet's name!
Usage
You can adjust the scad file to customize the design to your own needs. The following parameters
are particularly relevant:
diameter - inner diameter (mm) of container.
opening_width - width (mm) of opening for bags.
name - name to engrave.
additional_line - additional line to engrave.
Use OpenSCAD to export objects to stl. You need to print two parts, a lid, and a container.
Using the customizer change Expert -> part to ""Container"" and export to stl.
Using the customizer change Expert -> part to one of the lid options, my personal preference
is ""Lid - Vertical Knurled"" and export to stl.
Recommended settings for printing are:
infill - 20%
layer_height - .2 mm
supports - yes

I'd have given proper attribution but of course the Thingiverse search function doesn't work. I've taken it and made it more for SLA resin printers so there's quite a bit more detail added and corrected to be more accurate to the real thing. Can be used for any miniatures table top games that use 1:100 scale models but of course it can be resized to whatever scale you need.
I am currently working on all of the West German direct fire vehicles so coming will be the Leopard 1, Leopard 2A4, Leopard 2A5, and Wiesel. So stay tuned for more designs!"
